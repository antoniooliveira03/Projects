Unfortunately, the day I visited, it snowed (>ω<)!　It was freezing, visibility was limited, and I couldn't walk around the campus as much as I would have liked. ...... It seemed that the place I went in for a break was a study room, and all the students were concentrating on their studies!
Walking through the snowy campus with the statue by my side, I felt a little bit smarter than before.","You know, one best universities world! I meek person wants visit Boston.

Gli edifici delle varie facoltà non sono visitabili, ma una passeggiata nei giardini in una bella giornata di sole può essere veramente gratificante. Gli edifici in mattoni rossi, i prati curatissimi, gli alberi (rossi in autunno) sono un paesaggio rilassante ed al tempo stesso entusiasmante, pensando che ti trovi in una delle più famose e prestigiose università al mondo.

The buildings of the various faculties cannot be visited, but a walk in the gardens on a nice sunny day can be really rewarding. The red brick buildings, manicured lawns, and trees (red in the fall) make for a relaxing yet exciting landscape, thinking that you are at one of the most famous and prestigious universities in the world.

The snow that has fallen in recent weeks does not deter me one bit. This condition has been endured by others, which has results in their success ultimately.

Όταν επισκέφθηκα την Βοστώνη ήταν μια καλή ευκαιρία να το δω από κοντά. Ωραία παλιά κτίρια σε φέρνουν σε άλλες εποχές. Στην εκκλησία που δεσπόζει είχαμε την τύχη την ώρα εκείνη να αρχίζει μια συναυλία μπαρόκ μουσικής. Η χορωδία από φοιτητές όλων των εθνικοτήτων με τέλεια απόδοση. Το μόνο που δεν ήξερα ότι τα κορίτσια άρχισαν να φοιτούν εκεί πολύ πρόσφατα.,2,27,7,2016,UTC,el,459,The well-known timeless University from which great personalities of humanity have graduated. When I visited Boston it was a good opportunity to see it in person. Nice old buildings bring you back to other times. In the church that dominates it we were fortunate at that time to have a concert of baroque music beginning. The choir of students of all nationalities with a perfect performance.

The tours start at 10:30 & run until 3:30 every half hour. Our tour guide, Francesca, was very informative, interacted with the group, and had a lot of information to share.
