You can easily walk in the campus and admire the magnificent buildings, including library. We visited it in the summer, during the holiday break, and it  was very quiet, really great to have a walk there. "

The buildings are beautiful, old and reminiscent of English architecture, but not a-lot was happening, good experience but you could do this in an hour. "

Apparently non-university guides are not welcome on this campus, and we were told that if we were accosted by any security personnel we would have to leave straight away. This did not happen, so we got a lot of historical information from our guide and a wander between the various interesting buildings on campus. Worth some time if you can manage it."

This iconic university campus is worth a visit, but do your homework. Just strolling through won't do as the campus proper is so big, encompassing blocks and blocks. We were there for the history and the architecture. As visitors, we were not allowed to enter Memorial Hall so we missed seeing an awesome historic building. Strolling through Harvard Yard, we enjoyed the crowds taking photos with the John Harvard statue (by the esteemed sculptor Daniel Chester French). We checked out Sever Hall by Henry Hobson Richardson, a mainstay in Boston! Also the 1813 University Hall by Charles Bulfinch. Again, as a visitor, we couldn't go inside Widener Library to explore Mr Widener's personal library. We moved on to the Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts, the only Le Corbusier building in this country. We visited the Harvard Art Museums, spending a couple hours enjoying their art collections. The campus is home to two buildings by Minoru Yamasaki (based in our home city of Detroit) so we checked his work here. Then got in the car to see two buildings by Moshe Safdie: Rosovsky Hall and the Class of 59 Chapel; both are buildings designed for contemplation and spiritualness. Totally enjoyed our four hours exploring the Harvard campus!!"

We also chose to do a student led tour which we highly recommend.  It is definitely worth just wandering around, at the very least just to get a feel.  The campus itself isn’t very large and doesn’t have many dining or resting spots within (there are plenty surrounding the campus).  It is also worth it to go to the library and just wander around."

But I could have been on any campus in N. America it felt. That said, we did a simple loop of 'Harvard Yard', gawked at a few buildings, spotted the erroneously credited John Harvard statue, then headed back to warmer climes.
If you're an academic and/or historian, maybe this would tickle your fancy more than mine. 
Was it pretty? Sure. Did it stoke images of ""the smartest students on the continent"" within me? Nope."

Our tour guide Truong was really informative and engaging, eager to answer all questions and tell us all about his experience at Harvard. It was a shame we weren't able to go into buildings but otherwise the campus is stunning.

Definitely recommend (but don't go into the small official Harvard shop, go into Coop, that's our biggest piece of advice)."

This made the visit not worth it as I could not properly show the campus to my children, with whom I was visiting.  Every other public venue in the Boston area happens to be open, including museums, stores and restaurants, but not Harvard.  This stark contrast underscores the stupidity of this policy as Harvard remains virtually the sole outlier in continuing the repugnant lockdown and creating an unwelcoming atmosphere for visitors."

The campus is huge, very impressive & most beautiful. This is an Institution of “Knowledge and Research”. 

It was a snow & rainy day of February month and was very cold making visitors hard to go around. 

Campus layout, building architecture and statues are very impressive. 

Observe the shining toe of the left shoe – it looks as if the visitors touch the toe with hands and rub it as respect to the Sir John Harvard.

The visit was around two hours long, and there's no access to the inside of the university which was a shame. However, it was refreshing to see students who are so enthusiastic about their university, and proud enough to openly promote it to strangers. They really are a credit to their university. I would highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Cambridge. Just don't make my mistake- I booked via Expedia, and was charged more than DOUBLE than I would've been had I paid on the day. Silly me falling for the ""these tickets are selling out"" scam and parting with double the money I should've."

Some of the stops were to see and learn about the history of The Widener Library, John Harvard Statue, Harvard Hall, The Dorms. In between the time was filled with anecdotes on life at Harvard. The tour ends with a visit to the gift shop which is also staffed by current students.  Well worth the visit."

She toured us around the various University yards and regaled us with tales about the founding of the University and the origins of the student halls and historical buildings we passed. She encouraged questions about her own experience and displayed an energy and enthusiasm which made time. I was particularly impressed to learn about the foresight of the colonists in founding the educational establishment way back in 1636. "

If you are coming organize a walking tour to get the most from the experience. Local students do a great one hour tour which is more insightful than other stuffy tour companies. 

The number of libraries in the area (77) will give you some idea of the scale of the place but you can’t get into them which was a major disappointment for us as s sit down with a book of newspaper would have been great. I totally get that students are trying to study but limited access would have been nice. 

The area around the university is like a new town so pretty soulless in my opinion. Spend the time in the university grounds or if the weather is good walk along the Charles river.

Reverend John Harvard, who bequeathed his entire library and half of his estate, is the University's namesake. Just 16 years following the landing of the Pilgrims, the original focus of Harvard University was to educate Christian clergy with its motto ""Truth for Christ and the Church"". Presidents, billionaires and Rhodes Scholars are only some of the illustrious graduates. The historic tree covered grounds with brick architecture are worthy of tour. The Gothic-Revival Memorial Hall/Lowell Complex was constructed in the 1870's to honor those men who served in the Civil War. Do enter this majestic building and view the colorful and stunning stained-glass windows, by both prominent artisans: Tiffany and LaFarge. Outside of University Hall in the Old Yard, take note of the bronze seated statue of John Harvard, and rub his golden left foot for good luck. Stroll past the 1916 Widener Library, the largest of Harvard's dozens of libraries, and don't miss the Memorial Church with its lovely light interior. We took the MBTA Red Line which delivered us to the Harvard Square Station. Easy, quick, convenient and inexpensive, this is a great means of travel. Up at street level when you depart the station, is a visitor kiosk for guidance. We walked the campus on a rainy day which I would not recommend, but it is doable. We had no other option.  A very enjoyable experience.

1. Tour does not take you anywhere inside the class rooms or dining halls or dorm room etc - it is all in the garden - from that perspective it was a shame to pay 15 USD.
2. Student led tour guides need to have a really loud voice else you really cannot hear what the person is saying - as the tour is completely outside and lot of noise from street traffic or construction

She gave us a brief history of Harvard, explained the play on the name with no Rs and even in the rain managed to keep us entertained.

The ubiquitous red-brown brick buildings added to the serious and sombre ambiance – Harvard crimson is the official colour. One abiding memory is a throng of Japanese tourists walking around with selfie sticks snapping photos of themselves. Nevertheless, this is America's oldest university, and one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, with a long line of notable alumni, as noted by other reviewers. This is evidenced by the number of writers, thinkers, and Nobel laurates to have studied here, reflected in the subtle academic vibe exhibited by the students and staff, passing through the central courtyard where commencement is held. 

This area is surrounded by a number of famous and historic buildings - the Widener Library, Harvard Memorial Church and both the white granite University Hall and Sever Hall. The landmark John Harvard statue, sitting on a 6 foot granite plinth, is located outside University Hall facing both Harvard and Massachusetts Halls, and the Johnston Gate. Audio files of historical information on each of the buildings in Harvard Yard can be downloaded. It is good that visitors are welcome to roam freely around the campus of this famous university and see how it feels to be on this campus.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is housed in the University Museum Building, and the affiliated Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is located at Divinity Avenue on the campus. This is a very active university, so, of necessity, there is limited access during academic sessions. We didn’t go on any of the guided tours but did avail of the tour pamphlets at the tour office.

This took away a little from the experience but the central area of the university was underwhelming. There’s a hodgepodge of architectural styles that you might expect in a place that has grown over the centuries but I’ve seen other historic colleges do a much better job of preserving the period and flavor of the founding times and original structures. This creates a more cohesive environment that I prefer.

Our tour guide Mike was constantly comparing Harvard to Yale university students and putting them down for not getting in.   He also mocked some of the architecture which I thought was unwarranted.

Also given some of the World greatest leaders & entrepreneurs have attended this great seat of learnig.
This is not any dig about anything about America or any other issue ok.
This was our 10th time to America because we think its a great coutry to visit. However.
i would have imagined the actual buildings & campus itself would have lent to being visuallly old & inviting eg some of the visually wonderful university's in Oxford & Cambridge in the UK.
Sadly no, they all look almost modern to the point you might of been walking round a new(ish) University any were in the modern world.
Our guide ""Trent"" was excellent, informative & worth the money at $12 pp the guided tour lasted 75 minutes.
Or maybe i got hold of the wrong end of the stick? or i have been spoiled in the many other wonderful buildings i have seen.

Anyone I spoke to there was very helpful.  I love walking the grounds, seeing the beautiful library, and wishing maybe someday I could attend to finish out my degree. I also spoke to a recent Harvard student on the airplane and he confirmed for me all the things that Harvard represents. The vast different cultures of people that attend there is just first class.

It's Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the oldest and richest and most prestigious university in the United States. Established in 1636 and located about 3 miles northwest of Boston, it is a private Ivy League research university whose history, influence and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities. Its $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution. Its library, the world's largest academic and private library system, comprises 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Its alumni include eight U.S. Presidents, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars and 130 Nobel Laureates. Impressed? My wife and I were visiting Boston for the first time and a trip to Harvard was a no-brainer. I wanted to see Harvard Stadium, home of the Harvard-Yale football game that dates to 1875. And I wanted to see Harvard Yard, the oldest part of the Harvard campus, its historic center and its crossroads. Bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge Street, Broadway and Quincy Street, the grassy area of 22.4 acres enclosed by fence with 27 gates contains most of the freshman dormitories, the school's most important libraries, Memorial Church, several classroom and departmental buildings and the offices of the Dean of Harvard College and President of Harvard College. So how do you see it all. You can't. For example, there are 20 museums of culture, science and digital collections on campus, including Harvard Art Museum, Arnold Arboretum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard Museum of Natural History and Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. The business school and athletic facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston. We started at the Welcome to Harvard Information Center at the Smith Campus Center, 30 Dunster Street, in Cambridge. Established in 1962, its mission is to serve as the ""front door"" to Harvard by providing historic and general information about the  campus. We arranged for a self-guided walking and driving tour of Harvard Yard and Harvard Stadium. But visitors can choose a student-led public walking tour or group tour for 15 or more people or private tour or audio tour or mobile tour, whatever suits your time and fancy. Harvard was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1973 and is listed as a U.S. Historic District."

It was his enthusiasm his heart poured out from every pore and his touch of humour interspersed between his accounts and anecdotes related to the university and the USA is highly appreciable. His pleasant accent, wit and spontaneity, not to speak of his obviously ivy league-ish intellectual caliber and on the top of it the way he made his listeners shed their inhibitions to carry them along with him all through with great aplomb has floored me. Mathew, you have a great future as a good human being, as you are now, and also to become a successful academicians/ or whatever you wanted to be in life besides, of course, a good communicator.

We made a special visit to come see the hallowed ground of Harvard.  As an educational institution, this is five stars.  There is not question about it, it's why we wanted to visit anyway.

The expectation against the actual campus is night and day.  First the amount of homeless around the exterior of the campus is surprising.  We were accosted for money on several occasions.  We watch two homeless yell at each other.  Homeless is not something you expect to say in the same sentence as Harvard.

Next, the campus is not that pretty.  It's a nice campus, but there is nothing special that catches your eye or lifts it up as beautiful.  Sidewalks go everywhere and cheap rope is used to keep people off the grass.

Last, nothing is available to see.  The key buildings you would love to see are not open without a tour.  Having kids in college, I appreciate this, but it's tough as a tourist.  Also, with all the homeless around the parameter of the campus, they can't let people in freely.

I was very disappointed with this campus.  I have visited so many campuses around the country.  The look, not the education, ranks in the lower half."
"2017-08-08T16:49:52-04:00","Desktop","5","review","1","Great experience and tour!","I went to Harvard with my family in July, seeing as it's such a great destination, and we were staying in the town Harvard, Massachusetts. Parking was relatively easy and close to find, which was a plus.

We did a Harvard walking tour, one that I couldn't find the place to review but was led by people in straw hats and t-shirts saying Hahvard. We had trouble finding the tour, but the Harvard faculty we asked were helpful. Our tour guide, Chase, was phenomenal, and made even my 14 year old brother, who was less than excited, enjoy the tour.

The campus is beautiful, and there were plenty of places to sit and relax along the way. There's a great gift shop with amazing sweatshirts (it's one of my favorite clothing purchases to date) and lots of places to eat around there.

While you really only need to see the campus once, it's a great trip regardless, especially for tourists wishing to see as much as the east coast as they can."
"2017-08-08T10:06:58-04:00","Mobile","5","review","3","This Is Not The Campus You're Looking For","This will be a rewarding visit, but don't look for a bucolic campus.
Harvard Yard is green, pleasant but more notable for its history and architecture. H.H. Richardson's Sever Hall and the Moot Court at Harvard Law school are worth your attention as are the many Harvard Museums. The Peabody Museum, famous for its glass flower collection, has an eye popping paleontology section which hosts a full size  Kronosaur skeleton-- a cousin to the Plesiosaur. Harvard's Fogg Art Museum now combines the collection of Harvard's other art museums which were previously dispersed around campus. The collection is fine and diverse. Across the street is the Carpenter Center which is housed in the only Le Corbusier building in the U. S.
Lesser known is the scientific instrument collection at the science center. Beautiful old brass and wood instruments give you a hands-on sense of the experience of researchers from centuries past. 
There is much more of course so a little home work before visiting will enrich your visit. You might get lost but don't be afraid to stop and ask directions. People are generally friendly interested in visitors.

Other tours that are out and making money will trick you into their own tour. 
We wanted to do the Historical Tour and then the Student Walking Tour that is detailed on the Harvard website. We searched for a long time for Smith Campus Center, Harvard Information Center, not realizing it was under construction. Per the website there is no charge for this tour. 
A waitress at our restaurant directed us to a tiny round building in a loop. A guy outside in a Harvard shirt with ""Tours"" sign directed us inside when I asked him about the Smith Center. Inside, two guys rang up $24.00 and acted like they didn't understand me and insisted that this was the historical tour. The guy outside said that this was the tour. We went on this stupid thing but I noticed that we only stayed in the public commons areas and then he lead us to a tiny shirt shop. 
Later on I found online the address for the Smith/Info Center and it was not the address of the above building. And with limited vacation funds, I wish to have that $24 bucks back. 
Advice: Know the exact address of where you need to go. Call ahead and clarify if there are charges. Search for a Harvard walking app or book and do your own tour as it is not a huge campus."

That said, my dad went here, and graduated from Harvard and Harvard Law, so I should be giving it 5 stars, but, sorry pops. I live close to Yale, where the scale is smaller, and the old buildings are more diverse. Here, the first impression is HUGE and BRICK. It's fun to wander around and look, but it seems impersonal, and many of the buildings are off-limits, so you're stuck just looking up all the time. At brick. You have to see it if you're in the area and haven't seen it, but it's a walk-though for stretching your legs more than anything else."

Harvard Yard spans 22 grassy acres & is enclosed by fences & gates.  The 5,500 sq. ft. Harvard Book Store faces the Yard.

The center courtyard where commencement is held is surrounded by University Hall, Sever Hall, the Widener Library, & Harvard Memorial Church.  

The John Harvard statue rests on a foundation outside the white granite University Hall.  

There are colorful chairs under the trees that provide shade for those who wish to read, eat, or rest.  Everything about the Harvard environment is inspiring.  An understated aesthetic vibe runs through it that's hard to define but genuine.

Take a walk through the yard, where all Harvard Freshman spend a year before being sorted into a house for the remaining three years, unless they join a social club or elect to live off campus. While in the yard, peek into memorial chapel - one of the few buildings open to the public.

Next, visit the Harvard Art Museum. The collections in this new museum are world class.

You also should check out the glass flowers at the Museum of Natural History - they are legendary. 

Make sure to take a quick walk through the Radcliffe Yard, which is across the Cambridge Common. It contains some of Harvard's oldest buildings.

The ART American Repatory Theater may have a show playing. Check ahead and build you visit around one. Many have gone to Broadway after being shaken down in this famed theater. 

Down the street form the ART is the famed home of poet Longfellow. If you like to walk. Continue down Brattle street away from the square. The homes are the finest in Cambridge. Also, the Mt. Auburn cemetery is also a favorite. 

Hungry, well your in luck. Italian, think Toscano or Benadetto. Burgers, go strait to BARTLEY'S. If not open, Tastey Burger or Shake Shack will hit the spot. Brunch, Henriettas table #1 and tres cher. If looking for affordable brunch, hit Park on lower JFK Street, excellent food a la cart. American Bistro, Harvest. French, Les Sablons. Both are fantastic. Want Hip with music most evenings, Beat Hotel. Finally, if you want over the top Mexican and it's cheap! Felipes is tour place. Drinks upstairs on the deck can be lots of fun during the warmer months, but arrive early or be prepared to wait for a while. Don't be scared off by the lines - they move quickly.

If your early and want breakfast, Darwins or Flour and on Mt. Auburn and Crema on the corner of Brattle are all popular with us locals. Do get a cup of hot chocolate in the winter - L.A.Burdicks - don't miss this opportunity on a cold day. Think thick delcious melting chocolate you can drink. Put it in the fridge and it becomes semi solid.

Plan to spend half a day and bring an appetite to this storied city across the river from Bean Town. "

He tooketh no selfies, so the statue of him is based on a favorite local pastime: good-natured speculation grounded in research. Behold what nearly four subsequent centuries hath wrought! Enjoy a walk, or sit, in the Yard, a four-season feast for architecture, landscape, and people-watching enthusiasts, and imagine the leaders, both celebrated and notorious, in politics (including eight U.S. presidents), law, humanities, arts, sciences, and business who have wandered through this Crimson space. Walk up the steps of Widener Library, a gift of a grieving mother in honor of her bibliophile son who perished on the Titanic. Visit Memorial Church, and especially the heartbreaking and astonishingly ornate World War I memorial, and be reminded that there are many from privileged backgrounds who do not dodge or scorn the ultimate sacrifice in the service of a larger good. Memorial Hall, with its rich, fantastic woodwork and stained glass windows, is a timely and hauntingly beautiful reminder of an American Civil War that often seems without end. Harvard extends far beyond the Yard area and has endless delights in store, from the Weeks Footbridge over the Charles River (try it at dawn or dusk for an unforgettable many-cupolaed sensory treat) to the Biz School, to the dazzling marbled magnificence of the Medical School Quad, to the green (in the environmental sense) and grand (in every sense) state-of-the-art Wasserstein Hall at the Law School.

2. Walk through the Science Center and marvel at the poor quality of the classrooms

3. Wander around the square and go to Pinnocio's pizza and get a tomato - basil slice. About as authentic a harvard experience as you will get.

4. The Art museum (I always forget the name) is good.

5. Toward the end of the day grab a drink at the bar of the Harvard Faculty Club. Just walk in like you own the place and say you are going to the bar and ask if they could point you in the right direction. Only do this if you are aged over 40 or are dressed nice. 

6. Walk across the river to the business school and look at the high temple of american corporate craziness. See if you can get into the cafeteria (called Spangler Hall, if I recall correctly). It's nuts.

7. Do the standard tour. It's part of the show.

8. Hang out in Harvard Square. Aside from studying, that's pretty much what the students do..."

There are students waiting outside the station who will give you a tour , I think they charge $12 .. However there is a little kiosk where you can buy a map of the area and the gentleman there informed that the official Harvard tours are free and run on the hour from an office round the corner . So we walked two minutes to the building he had indicated for us and sure enough this was the proper tour . The girl who took it was a fourth year student from Austin Texas ( I've forgotten her name ) , but she was a great guide .. Very informative and pleasant .. She took us through the various areas and explained some of the history of the people and events that had happened here . The tour took approx an hour and I'm glad we did it .. We returned to the subway went back to MIT. Think the station is called Kendal and jumped on the next trolley bus that came along .. Excellent diversion and added to our experience in the Boston area"

When I got there I decided to go on one of the official tours, which I had to wait but didn't mind. I watched an Anti-Trump demonstration. Not being US Citizen thought that the students put their arguments eloquently and superbly; kudos to them. The tour guide was very enthusiastic and it was evident that he loved everything about being a Harvard student. His knowledge impressed me and the historical stories he told were first rate and entertaining. Upon completion of the tour I wished him all the best.

One thing, and I guess this is just my personal perception, I thought that Harvard University would be bigger than it was. It's relatively small which surprised me, but when you're one of the worlds most prestigious University you don't need to be big.

The buildings are impressive, and I can imagine that it's been like so since the day it opened. Definitely worth a visit, even if you're not an academic or history enthusiast, it's just a good place to visit."

We took the red line subway from Quincy Market to Harvard than backed the same route that is cheaper than uber or taxi only need $5.5 round trip. It is also convenience transportation.  When we came out the Harvard station it is the Harvard Square. There are a lot of  restaurants and souvenir shops in Harvard Square. Also, many architectures of Harvard are close to Harvard Square.

Visitors need not pay any fee to enter into Harvard University. We saw  lots of brick buildings and took some pictures in front of these buildings. We are most impressed with is the statue of John Harvard. Actually, at the beginning, we not found it until we notice many people gathered to there. The statue has a nicknamed which is the “statue of three lies” because of all the inaccuracies inscribed on it. The three lies are that is not real John Harvard, he did not attend the College and Harvard University was not founded in 1638.

True, many of his jokes must be told by all the guides but his presentation reminded me of a stand up comic who is dying on stage, pretty hilarious.  The tour goes into the history of the school, notable students, etc.  What I found interesting was that we visited just before the start of school.  It was pretty funny how the new Freshmen were welcomed by current undergrads.  They surrounded the ""lost and confused"" Freshmen and struck out in a loud/energetic sound and dance routine.

Some buildings the public can gain access to (although signage lists them as restricted). The interesting parts of Harvard are certainly easy to find, there is so much more to Harvard than the central core of the university. I strongly urge visitors to travel the less trodden paths and view some of the off the beaten path buildings, alleys, yards, and buildings. Many of these offer extraordinary views of art and architecture that is steeped in history. Please, avoid the canned tours and take a few minutes to sit on the lawn and take in the feel of the true Harvard. It is a living institution that happens to be part museum and very much a part of history.

There are gates all around the campus - it appears they're dedicated by different classes, as their year is included in the wrought iron work.

I wanted you to be the first to know, I just entered Harvard!""  Poor guy.  He was so proud in that moment, and so disappointed the next, when I explained that I wouldn't be there more than an hour.

I'm always struck by just how early the tours get going, and how many people are on campus.  Early mornings are my favorite, as it's quiet, shady and very few folks are around. The chairs around the Yard are usually empty in the mornings. By afternoon, it is tricky to navigate my way back through as I weave between tours in various languages and every chair is usually taken. The nearby food trucks make this a great stop for lunch, too."

Harvard Square is literally outside the gates. It's a little more buffed and polished over the last 25 years, fewer local shops, more chains trying to look ye-old shoppe or hipster modern.

"2016-07-04T12:38:08-04:00","Mobile","4","review","1","DIY walking tour in Cambridge ","I stayed at Boston Park Plaza near Public Garden, and form there I walked over to Harvard University. The thing I enjoy most when visiting a new place is just walking around to really see and experience the area. From my hotel to Harvard, it was a   an-hour-and-12-minute walk, according to Google Maps. If you are an urban hiker and are OK walking this kind of distance like me, read on!

From Public Garden, there are many streets running parallel to one another. I walked on all of them and the Esplanade toward Harvard Bridge. They are all charming. Newbury offers high-end shopping and the view of the Charles River walking along the Esplanade is wonderful. 

After crossing Harvard Bridge, you see MIT. I visited on the 4th of July, so unfortunately everything was closed. Otherwise, I would have been interested in visiting MIT Museum. After seeing MIT, stay on Massachusetts Avenue no matter what Google Maps says. I typed in Harvard University as my destination, and really got lost. So try some other destination or just stay on Massachusetts till you see Harvard. 

The area surrounding the University is very charming, with lots of eateries and shops. The red brick campus is, of course, worth a visit. Now, here's one of the highlights of my walking tour:

Whenever I plan a walking tour like this,  especially on Sunday or major holidays, I really worry about whether or not there are any toilets along the way. ( Harvard and MIT are universities, not amusement parks, people! ). I did some search and found a very recent article saying ""the very first public bathroom in the Harvard area made a ""grand opening"" in February, 2016!  The article sounded like the appropriateness of putting a public loo right in front of Harvard was controversial for many reasons. I was so curious I went to find it, and to see if it's really there.

The bathroom was very clean and  spacious, and very good-looking. Only one stall. For those who go to a bathroom twice a day, it might be laughable for me to write this much about one. But for others, it is an important issue. If I hadn't stumbled on the article about this new addition to the area, I probably would have visited Aquarium on the 4th. 

So, to whomever came up to this idea and made it happen, thank you very much. I really enjoyed visiting Cambridge on Independence Day, 2016.

Have them look up Widener Library and who Harry Widener was and why all Harvard students must pass a swimming test.
Memorial Church is directly across from the library.  You may be able to respectfully enter and attend a service there and read the wall to your right where those from Harvard who died in WWII are listed.  Note the 3 Roosevelts.  Why are they on the wall?  Should poor Kermit be there?  Talk about FDR's role in this war.
Find the statue of 3 lies.  Rub it's toe - it's just what you do.  Have the kids tell you the 3 lies.
Find the site of the building occupied by General Washington and his staff during the Revolutionary War...your kids will be able to look this up...they basically took over Harvard, eh kids?  There is a plaque describing the fort built as directed by Gen. Washington at 101 Waverly Street in Cambridge; it's embankments are the only remaining Revolutionary War bits in Cambridge.  Where is this in relation to the Charles River and why did the General have it constructed there, kids?
Parents, explain why the Harvard Science Center was referred to as the Polaroid Building.  Point out the ways in which it really looks like a Polaroid camera (consult your own parents, as necessary).  The kids can look up who funded it.  Why aren't Polaroid cameras and film made anymore?

It was after the graduation ceremonies and the university was now closed so ypu could walk around the grounds without too many people.
It's free to visit but keep in mind that you can not enter buildings etc.
It's only 15-20 minutes from downtown Boston and you could go by subway but even a taxi ride across the river is about 20 dollars each way and that way you could see a bit of Cambridge

The hanging out version:

Breath the culture, mingle with the students, start conversations, ask what people like, sit just down and enjoy the atmosphere, stroll around not missing out the library building offering you the exposer to a lot of very individual persons, who for instance just occupy the benches, hang out in the internet, stretch out and sleep or talk with you cause you seem to have time. Like that you'll spend a jolly day and remember for ever Harvard was a place feeling you good.

Making a museums tour version:

You can of course also book or make a tour for instance and you gonna meet the 
Harvard Museum of Natural History, Harvard University Herbaria, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Harvard Universitria and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum and if you've swallowed it all, you may remember Harvard is a place making you smart. Such tours can be booked in local tourist agencies and will cost you about 20 dollars (Jan 2016)

Exploring the surroundings version:

Of course even in times of Netflix and Spotify the students love to meet somewhere and getting entertained. Meaning after looking around and enjoying little cafés and bars offering healthy stuff (naturally raised chicken making the premium price of your Caesar Salad for instance) you will find a number of local clubs, to hang out and listen to some good music, playing chess or back gammon in public or dare to sit down and show off playing master mind - just because you may feel so much inspired.

Should you be around in winter times like me don't miss ice skates, because there is mostly an ice scating parcour built up.

Whatever version you choose , have fun !"

Harvard University is located in Cambridge, just a short metro ride out of downtown Boston. Once in Cambridge, it isn't hard to find Harvard University since it seems that the little town sprung up because of the University. Book stores, coffee shops and cafes line the sidewalks of Cambridge; everything I had always imagined this little place would be. I love it! 
Once on the campus of Harvard, just walking around is the perfect tour, as the college seems to speak for its self with the beautiful architecture and tree lined sidewalks and walkways. The campus offers tours, but I would suggest looking on line for further details on that. 
I suggest grabbing a picnic and a good book, and sitting under one of the many old trees on the campus. The hustle and bustle of the students going back and forth, the professors running here and there, all make for the perfect afternoon at Harvard University."

He assured us we could ask him anything & he knew all the fascinating historical facts behind the buildings we visited which helped everyone truly appreciate the surroundings that much more. Don’t forget to pass beneath the massive iron Harvard gate that students must pass beneath twice while at Harvard – once when they enter the school & once when they leave upon graduation.

I believe our tour guide's name was Gaby. She was awesome! I loved how real and authentic she was. She was extremely knowledgable. The best part of going on the tour with Gaby is that she always made people feel comfortable to approach her with any questions. She did a fine job talking about the financial aid process. This is by far the best college tour I've ever taken! 

I was unsure of the gratuity situation which is unfortunate because she was stellar!

I would describe it as a bee hive.There a people everywhere walking talking someone from all over the earth in one place. They make a beautiful collage of sight and sound. These students and visitors seem to fall into an easy cadence. These kids do not seem rushed or anxious. The campus is full of seats and toys. ie; the colorful chairs in the square and the exercise stations on the walk way. Make sure to check out the shops and  eateries in the mall entrance. Don't over look the lunch trucks. A walking tour is fast paced and full of information that you can not see by looking. There is a lot to see and may not be accomplished in one visit.
It is good for home schooling, dates and people watching. The students are dressed in enough interesting garb that photo studies of them in contrast to their surroundings would be fun. a trip to the museum should be a specific stop as there is so much to see. There is a cafe and in court seating.
This venue is in town. The space is smaller than anticipated. Parking is at a premium."

As I had only about 2 hours to spend at Harvard University, I decided I could get a glimpse of some of the highlights of Harvard University by attending one of the Official Harvard Tour.

The Official Harvard Tour has its earliest tour of the day start at 10 a.m. As I was in Harvard area very early, I signed up for the tour way before 9.30 a.m. I subsequently learnt that it was helpful to be early to sign up for the Official Harvard Tour. The tours were so popular that the 10 a.m. tour was fully booked before 9.45 a.m. However, as registration starts only one hour before a designated tour, it does help to plan ahead the visit to the Harvard Events and Information Center in Holyoke Center so as to secure a place on the Official Harvard Tour.

The Official Harvard Tour was led by one of the student volunteers. In addition to attending the Official Harvard Tour, I bought myself a copy of ""A self-guided walking tour of Harvard Yard and surrounding areas"".

The Official Harvard Tour brought us to various locations on Harvard Yard such as the Massachusetts Hall, the Harvard Hall, the Science Center, the Memorial Hall, the Widener Library and the site of the John Harvard Statue.

I love the spaciousness of Harvard Yard, and it was a lovely experience being there on a day in summer.

During the tour, I learnt that the Memorial Hall is the building whereby first-year students of Harvard would dine in so as to foster a sense of community. The Massachusetts Hall is the oldest building that is still standing at Harvard. I felt privileged to be visiting Harvard University which has a long history.

It would be nice to offer a gratuity at the end of the tour.

If any one wants more after the Official Harvard Tour, I heard that there is a fun alternative to the Official Harvard Tour. It's the Hahvahd Tour."

After we finally reached the centre, we were told that the hourly tours were fully booked and we had to wait for the next hour. Opted to purchase a $2 Harvard self-guided tour map which turned out to be the better choice because that allowed us to choose which sites to visit and see and which to skip rather than to go to every single one which can be time consuming and to some extent boring or repetitive. Don't get me wrong, the place is nice but having been to other famous universities, Harvard does pale somewhat in comparison and isn't really worth the traveling out just to see the school."

Is has a lot of history and is actually pretty impressive. But as a university campus fanatic, I am more looking at the architecture. The style at Harvard is beautiful. The thing is, I was really expected to fall on my back. I have bean a student at McGill in Montreal, and our campus is known to be stunning. I guess it may be hard to beat it, but I have seen plenty of pictures of other american campuses that are wonders of architecture. Sadly we did not have the time to pass by, but I think MIT offers more on that matter. I did love the school of business though. 

Important point for anyone planning to visit, it is VERY LARGE. Plan for at least 2h00 to visit the most important schools and be ready to walk A LOT. 

A good tip: there is free wi-fi as you arrive at Harvard Square. Take the time to download the PFD map of Harvard, which can be saved in Ibook (for IPhones...). Saved me a lot of data to get around the places."

There are several entrances to the main Harvard yard and students, families and couples walk around and do various things including picnic in the summer and fall. In the winter is it a great place to sit and appreciate the serenity of snow and see students from all over the world passing by. They could have more sitting areas inside the main yard, but just outside of it they have several restaurants and cafes. It is wonderful to hear locals play their music and at times perform."

The video presentation at the beginning was entertaining.  The student-led tour though was somewhat disappointing and while we know some of this may be due to the personality and knowledge of the student leading it, we never went inside any buildings - dorms, classrooms, library or any others; meanwhile at MIT it was more immersive and we felt like we knew what life would feel like there through our own eyes, not just what was told to us."

Entry is restricted to many locations due to campus security concerns.  In the Harvard Square area you will see the Plaza, Winthrop Park and Mount Auburn Street.  Tour ends near the Shop / Bookstore so you can get souvenirs.  Many eateries close by (though some tour versions include either a stop at the Harvard Museum of Natural History, or lunch at a restaurant called 'Fire and Ice'.  Enjoy!"

"2015-07-06T22:40:43-04:00","Desktop","5","review","0","Lovely campus with a long traditional history and academic achievements!","We were here in the early morning (around 8am) as part of our day tour in Boston and this was the first stop of the day. Upon arrival, we were impressed with the campus, with satellite kind of clusters among academic schools, hostels, retail and F&B outlets, among many others. We were also attracted to the various red-brick buildings. They were very nice and magnificent and solely the property of the University. In deed, this place was just like a mini-town by itself and its full of energy, vibe and activities on going.

We walked around the campus and soon we came by the most visited place in the campus. The statue of the sitting ""Mr Harvard"". Many people came forward to be photographed and touching the ""leg"" and hopefully their children/grandchildren will be blessed to be as smart. Haha, a myth? Anyway, just to clarify that this person was not Mr Harvard (the founder of the institution) himself. As in those days, the university was unable to find a photo of Mr Harvard himself when erecting a monument in honour of him, it organized a contest to look for the ""most good looking"" person and selected the winner to have the monument made after him. So this ""Mr Harvard"" was handsome. This story was shared to us by our guide.

The campus was lovely and serene, with buildings surrounding greenery landscape and with chairs and benches around for students or visitors to sit and rest while enjoying the beauty of the campus. There was a train station in the campus, besides many nice architectural buildings like churches as well.

So we walked around the campus with a feeling of being a ""Harvard"" student and somehow feel ""proud"" to be one as the university is world ranked Number 1.

We came by the campus circle where eateries, cafes and retail shops were located and had our breakfast there. People here were orderly and well mannered and polite. Prices here were reasonable and cheaper than elsewhere. Thereafter, we walked around the gift and book stores nearby, grabbing up some books and souvenirs.

Finally, we landed at the Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences where I caught up with my associate for a while. Visited briefly on the LTs as well and was briefed about the history of the university and the years of transformation. I was then led to the Co-op store, ran by the students on vacation and bought some gift items as well as a form of support.

It was a lovely walk-around trip in Harvard university in Cambridge in Boston. The feeling was so closed to heart, perhaps due to the fact that I am an academic too. Shortly later, when returning to my coach, the place got busier and more pedestrians crowd jostling among buildings, traffic lights and cafes. Well, its the start of another day in campus!

Highly recommend for a visit!"

The grounds are in the middle of town, and I found, that although it is very famous, there is not the peace and calm there, that it would benefit the students.

It is pretty crowded there, with all the people visiting town, and the buildings are for sure well built.  But if they are still suitable for a more modern way of studying is the question. 

I must admit, it is a famous university,
it has lots of reputation,
the students have all the advantages of being hired after they studied there,
but..... I would prefer a different university to do my own studies if I would have to
do it again.

It is just too restrictive, too formal for my liking.  But I am an old geezer, and that might

You can't cover the entire campus in a little over an hour, but this gave you some fun facts and the opportunity to ask questions.  We bought our tickets at the news stand near the info desk about a half an hour before the tour.  So, probably no need for reservations.  The price was the same as the on-line price.

This works best, of course, when the university is in session. In the summer, you might see students who look much too young -- this is not just because you are getting older, but because it is Harvard Summer School, which enrolls many high school students."

Strolling around and in the campus premises is a good exercise. Walking past the Harvard Square, you'll see inside the campus John Harvard's statue and the Library. Unless you want and intend to get in this University, I don't think you need to walk all around and see the entire campus. Nevertheless, it is interesting to see and be in its vicinity.

The 90 minute tour of the Harvard campus is a really great way to glean a little about the history of this great institution. 

The tour is conducted by Harvard students and our guide, a sophomore from Vermont, was excellent. She was fully conversant with the history, had an engaging personality and a great sense of humor. 

It was interesting to hear about the 'back stories' of some of the personalities who have made this institution a world leader. It wasn't all 'historic' in that sense; we were introduced to two of the university's modern influential characters: Gates and Zuckerberg. 

The Harvard student led tour is a great experience.  Afterwards, hang around Harvard Square and enjoy the ambience."

I was surprised how poorly the tour guides (this was the official tour for the University) and the people on the tour are treated while on campus. There was one instance of what I took to be a professor openly mocking our tour guide and people in another building telling our tour that we could not stay in their building - it was only for people associated with the University. However, the lore of Harvard managed to over-ride the snobbishness of some of its staff. I then extended my tour by walking over much of the rest of the campus - a fascinating campus to explore."

If you want to see one of the oldest universities in the United States, a tour of Harvard is worth your time. The Harvard Yard is both aesthetically pleasing and immaculately maintained; and when you walk through the arches to enter the yard, you quickly realize you are stepping back into history-- in fact, some of the buildings go back several hundred years. 

The campus has a number of excellent museums which are open to the public, and the Harvard Archives are a delight for any historian or researcher who wants to learn more about the many famous people who attended Harvard.  You don't have to be a student to appreciate what the Harvard campus has to offer, from art and natural history exhibits to educational lectures to music festivals; and if you take the tour, you will also see many interesting varieties of architecture.  It is not surprising that so many out-of-town tourists make sure a visit to Harvard is part of their trip to the Boston/Cambridge area. While walking around Harvard Yard or taking the tour is free, some of the museums do have an admission charge, but it is generally very reasonable.  There is limited on-street metered parking available, but a few parking lots are in close proximity.  However, if possible, you are better off going by public transportation, which will give you more freedom to take your time, wander the campus, and enjoy all that Harvard University has to offer."

Its major negative is the discomfort of the too shallow/ crowded bench seating, (and the [basement level] bathrooms are reached down long steep stairways) but the rich beauty of the interior design, wood panelling and the stained glass windows and carved quotes, along with the warm clear acoustics, easily offset the discomfort. 
What never ceases to move me is in the high vaulted space of the lobby. Memorial Hall was indeed built as a memorial- to all the Harvard boys who died in the Civil War. When you read the marble plaques that line the walls,with their names and the places where they died,  you really do realize the sadness of that War- that was so essential to forming the country that we have become. It always makes me stop and reflect, and appreciate the sacrifice of such young boys. 

Memorial Hall was designed by the very famous Victorian architects, Ware and Van Brunt, and within a block of it are many other famous buildings. The modern School of Architecture and Landscape Design is right across the street, designed by local architect, Graham Gund. Just down the street is the Carpenter Center of Visual Arts, the only American building designed by le Corbusier. And more examples abound throughout the campus."

The representatives of Harvard were not welcoming. As a matter of fact, they were rude. There were no places for our students to sit. It was in the middle of a snowstorm and people were coming in and out of the building covered in snow. With no where to sit, our students had no choice but to sit--in their dress clothes--on the damp floor. There wasn't enough seating, enough food, or enough space for the number of students competing. None of the (dirty, seemingly forgotten) rooms were marked nor set up for our events. This was Harvard's chance to impress and inspire these high school students; instead, the students left wondering what all the hype is about.

Harvard Yard is very close to the transit station and was the highlight of my visit to Harvard/Cambridge. Some lovely large old buildings and coloured chairs on the lawns. If you are there in the Fall/Autumn the trees are changing colour and offer some lovely picture opportunities. Obviously a place steeped in history and learning and we just wandered around by ourselves soaking up the atmosphere for half an hour or so.

It is well worth a visit and the best and most memorable part of my morning in Harvard. If you are visiting from Boston then we found a morning or afternoon was enough."

It was a short ""T"" trip via the red line, headed towards Alewife. The station name is ""Harvard"" and it brings you right to the famous Harvard Square. We joined a Student-Led Tour that departed from the Harvard Information Center, in the Smith Campus Center.

It was a walking tour of adult tourists not students. Our student leader was Jimmy. He was very familiar with the campus history, facts and details of the buildings interjected with lots of personal antidotes. Very enjoyable, personable and interesting young man.

We enjoyed the wonderful warm fall day and toured the following: Harvard Yard, Freshman dorms, Tercentenacy Theater, Widener Library, Memorial Hall, a Science centre, the John Harvard Statue and more. We did not enter any of the buildings except for the Memorial Hall. The building are amazing...red brick, some 300 years old. There are mature trees and wonderful roof lines to admire as well as steeples and grassy slopes. The architecture was striking...with a mix of traditional striped roofs and modern glass buildings from the 1070s.

After completing the tour we ambled around the campus to look at the Harvard Lampoon building. A quirky building with a smiling mouth and eyes. We recommend wandering the campus and enjoying all the free statues and the heritage buildings with their dormer windows. Breathtakingly Beautiful!

If you have time and the weather is fair, I recommend a short walk along the Charles River for a look at the buildings and bridges

Being tourists, we also stopped into the Coop store for some retail therapy. Lots of Harvard souvenirs to be purchased!

The campus is well worth an afternoon of touring! Apparently there are 100 plus iron gates...we only saw a few, maybe next time!"

The student who guided us was quite delightful and did not fit my image of a typical Harvard student at all.

After 10 minutes we had to leave the tour - while it's pretty interesting to hear the world-leading uni's story from an actual Harvard student, her voice was totally overwhelmed by the rain and I could hardly hear her in a 30-strong crowd. 

I ended up downloading the free Harvard Yard tour app on my iPhone and did my own exploration. The app depends on Internet access to function but throughout the Harvard Yard you should be able to access the free (albeit slow) uni guest wifi access. The app does a pretty good job at providing historical and sometimes humorous perspective on the famous university. 

Overall I enjoyed the visit to the university - but I am a nerd and being in Harvard was half the enjoyment itself. If ""one of the world's best universities"" does not interest you on itself, you may not find the Harvard Yard interesting. Most buildings are off limit so all you could see is really just the facade of the buildings, and this may not be all that interesting if you belong to the ""sightseeing tourist"" category."

This beautiful town Cambridge across the River Charles, off the Boston, counts for its own as the city ,though one could assume that it is one extension of the main city of the Massachusetts.
Here, whole campus with grounds ,yards, gorgeous buildings of different fields of the science, the monuments of the most deserved men throughout the history of the Harvard are at the reach of us, the visitors, the tourists. Like for instance, the sitting statue of the first  Harvard benefactor, John Harvard ,who was also the alumnus of the University of Cambridge. After his decease ,the name of Harvard College was honored to the existant institution of Cambridge University.
That was in the 1636, the year of Harvard University establishment.
We enjoyed at the times to walk on these green yards and around the buildings, perceiving this splendid architecture of the edifices, acknowledging the great University history and also getting acquainted with the nowadays life of that grand Campus.
We saw within these grounds, the greatest library in the world, the Widener Library.
Some sculptures of the renown sculptors as Henry Moore adorn the Harvard University gardens.
That is outstanding place to be seen for all the times."

Look out for the statue of the three lies - a  fascinating example of not letting the truth get in the way of a good story. The range of authentic Harvard-branded goods on sale in the Coop is massive, if this is what you want. There are lots of eating options in the area as well. This is a great way to occupy half a day."

You can grab your free tickets (for a specific timed tour) from Harvard Information Centre across the gates into Harvard on Massachusetts Avenue. The girl we had, had just  graduated from Harvard and this was her last tour. She did a great job of providing us with the history of Harvard. Explained what the buildings were used for, what life was like at this university. It made the tour very informative and personal for us. The campus itself was very beautiful, the architecture of the buildings was just stunning. And the tree lined grounds making it a wonderful place to study or just relax after class. We had a great time visiting and the surrounding area is also very nice to visit. There's plenty of cafés around to enjoy a coffee afterwards."

Perhaps it's because of the way Hollywood makes it look in movies like Legally Blonde, but the old historical part of campus (Harvard Yard) is quite small. It's a pleasant space, no doubt. Chairs scattered across the lawn shaded by tall trees make for a nice place to stop and rest. However, the rest of campus is a vast expanse of nondescript brick buildings. Even the few free museums we went into failed to impress. The Semitic Museum's collection seemed to comprise solely replicas of famous artifacts, although it did have a lot of information on Cyprus, which I suppose impressed us. Boston if full of historical buildings and shady green spaces to wander around. Harvard didn't stand out from any of the others, and they don't require a long metro ride."

Weather-wise it is very welcoming, neither cold nor hot, of course, there might be occasional drizzles. Fresh intelligent faces are in all smiles because the exams are over and now it is party time. Some are perhaps little sad because the time has come to bid adieu to this wonderful place and their pals, join the real world and contribute to the welfare of mankind. It is a common sight to find youngsters with their parents and siblings who have come from long distances just to be with the graduating wonder in this joyous occasion. They proudly sport caps, t-shirts, jackets etc with logo of Harvard Dad/Mom/ Brother et al. The shopkeepers first congratulate them before doing the business. Service staff in restaurants, many of whom are students themselves, welcome these guests with words which come from their deep within. Cabbies entertain with all kinds of questions. Even the Police, who usually maintain a stony countenance, are a smiling lot. Joy is all-pervasive; it is beyond description. You have to be there to get a real feel of it.  "

He was a great story teller and wove in his personal experience of this great University.

(4) do take a photo at the steps of the Widener Library. It is a memorial to Harry Widener, who perished with the Titanic in 1912. Harry has a study room inside, and a desk with  a vase replenished with fresh flowers every day. The library has 50 miles of shelves and Harvard students aim to make out among the shelves once before graduating.

(3) do visit Harvard Yard during Winter - the snowmen outside the freshmen halls range from Easter Island statue lookalikes to Picasso-esque women.

(2) do enjoy Harvard Yard on a Sunday morning - the bells of Memorial Church ring first, then near to noon, the bells of Lowell Hall chime fantastically for about an hour. In between there is quiet and beauty, birds, squirrels and rabbits.

(1) do visit on Moving- in Day (end Aug). See the freshmen from all over the US and the world move in to the freshmen halls which surround The Yard. There is a festive air. Student advisors are on hand to tell visitors all about Harvard and various groups give out Harvard memorabilia, chilled lemonade and brochures."

Particularly if you're from the western part of North America, the age of some of the  the buildings alone will keep you interested. (Harvard was founded in 1636) We wandered down the hallways of one of the older buildings, and overheard a student being examined by a panel of professors - in Latin. There are several good places on campus and nearby to grab some good souvenirs like the requisite t-shirt or hoodie. 
A tip: if you want the true student experience, schedule your visit over lunch, and eat in the freshmen's cafeteria. Online reviews of the food rate it as good/not great. These are obviously people who haven't gone to school elsewhere; by cafeteria standards it's above par. The attraction is the room itself, called the Memorial Hall, built to honor the Harvard Alumni who perished during the American Civil War in defence of the Union. It's quite the building, and the meal is reasonably priced."

Being from the south, Ivy League schools appear so distant and unobtainable, but the feel of the environment made you feel that anything is possible with hard work.

Maybe it's because the institution has been coasting on its reputation for a century.  Maybe it's because I read one story after another in the local papers about its attempts to manipulate the community.  But there's not that much to see here.  Harvard's grounds are not that attractive -- not nearly so as any of a hundred campuses across the country.  One can listen to the stories of past notables.  Or one can consider the embarrassments of the current institution -- the B-School which helped drag down the economy, the Ed-School which has mucked up the system of public education in this country. 

Want to go for a place for a nice walk?  Try the Fresh Pond Reservoir, the Minuteman Bike Trial, the Charles River trails, or the Mt. Auburn Cemetery.  Wander around a bit at Harvard if you want to see some stodgy, rather unattractive buildings, but god help you if you spend money for a tour.

A walk through the Harvard Yard it well worth doing - we went in late October so the autumn colours added to the sense grandeur of this institution and the grounds.

If you have time visit the Memorial Church and stand in front of Widener Library & take in the enormity of this building and of course don't forget to touch the foot on the John Harvard Statue.
There is a walking tour which is conducted by students and is called Hahvahd Tour - it starts from just outside the Harvard T stop - if I had know about this before arriving I would have connected with this tour as it looked like it was fun and informative the couple of times I crossed paths with the tour group on my walk through the campus.

There are a few options for tours of Harvard but we elected the official tour provided by current students. This was apples to apples to the Yale tour we took. 

We were expecting much more from the Harvard tour. Unfortunately, it was rather boring as compared to the Yale tour. Perhaps it was the guide, but there were few fun, interesting historical stories. The tour was so dry, I think we would have had a better experience just roaming on our own. 

Harvard Yard is pretty with nice grassy areas and trees. It had colorful chairs in the center of the grass where students can hang out. There are a lot of historical buildings but the architecture isn't nearly as interesting as that of Yale. It was all just a little disappointing but we are glad we did it. Honestly, the campus is nothing special compared to many other campuses we have attended or explored. 

If we were students comparing the schools and taking the tours, we'd pick Yale hands down. 

Another note, there are no parking lots in the area. You have to use metered parking which is a max of 2 hours and accepts only quarters. If you plan on touring around, you will need to have quarters handy and be ready to make your way back to the meter a few times to add time."

We loved walking through the grounds and while we didn't have time to take a guided tour we picked up on enough of the history to appreciate the surroundings.  The historic buildings emit an atmosphere of devotion to education and learning amid abounding stories of notable Americans.  We saw evidence of the Kennedys attendance here and a bit of nostalgia surrounding the era of the Kennedy family.  A stroll through the town-like streets was picturesque and low-key but enjoyable.

She had no written script and certainly wouldn't have needed one. She encouraged us to ask questions and did - as far as I can tell - a great job of answering them. All in all, this added a lot to our experience of Harvard and its history.

The Harvard yard itself (open and free of charge to visit) is rather impressing, with old buildings where lots of old presidents and other famous business people and celebrities have waked the corridors. Having been to Cambridge (England) and stayed in a college dorm room there for a short while, I was maybe not as hugely impressed with the Harvard campus as I otherwise would have been, yet it is indeed a place where it's well worth spending a few hours."

There are some restaurant outside the campus on Mass Ave. Chinese, italian, so on. The Harvard Coop store might be interesting to people who would like to take something about Harvard back home. Although they items are mostly overpriced, with a Harvard logo.

It was $10 per person for a 1 hour guided tour through a small part of Harvard university as the university is very spread out.
Our guide was a student of Harvard. It was overall a disappointing tour. The guide stuck to her script (even closed her eyes when reciting it back to us) and the humour was really poor and much too scripted. The guide also was required to walk backwards which was very disconcerting and I felt that I had to watch out for her in case she would walk into something/someone.
We didn't actually get much of an insight into student harvard life nor were we told a lot about some of the more famous people who would have passed through the university.
I think the organisers of this tour should do a little bit of investigation into how other historical universities carry out their tours. My husband was on the Trinity College tour in Dublin a couple of weeks later and even though it was only 30 mins long he thought it was far superiour to the Harvard Tour and the guide was excellent."

If you want to see some old buildings, just walk through Boston downtown. It does not worth the long T trip. All buildings were locked, art museum was closed until Fall 2014, the library did not issue me a day pass because i did not bring a letter from my advisor (I am a PhD student and this is the most ridiculous practice I have ever seen.

A great half day activity that doesn't break the bank. Take the 15-20 minute subway trip out to Cambridge and take the Student lead tour through Harvard University. The cost of the trip is $10.00 and money well spent. The tour company is run by Harvard University students and all the proceeds go back to the students. The tour start is located at the main exit  from Cambridge Subway. You will be meet by a person who will direct you to a small newspaper stand where you pay your money and get your ticket.  You then take your ticket back to the person who then gives you a sticker. It is a little round about but it works.

Our tour guide was a third student who was 5 foot and 1 inch tall named Brett (This is how he introduced himself). He was a pocket rocket, he was very enthusiastic about showing the group around, telling great stories of the going on's of the students, pointing out where famous graduates or 'non graduates' lived and studied and informing the group of the history of America's oldest university. The tour is two hours long and finishes at a park just outside the university walls. There is a great cafe located here for lunch and just around the corner is the subway for the trip back to Boston. My wife and I enjoyed it no end.  We explored the campus further after the tour and their Business College campus were beautiful with well manicured gardens!"

When we entered the grounds, I already felt its greatness and now it is still one of the great universities around the world, that even royal people felt honored to study and graduate there. the grounds are really wide and it took sometime for us to finish the walk, and to take pictures of the different areas. It also took a while to pose in front of the statue of the founder of the university. The trip was really worth it! "

It's a good way from the centre of Boston but easily accessible by T line or bus.  We were there when it was pouring with rain so ran for shelter into the church.  This turned out to be a major result as it was stunning and a real example of Boston's historical past. We were doubly lucky in that we had it all to ourselves and then a gentleman started to play the wonderful organ.  It was like a wonderful oasis from the weather and the traffic."

We visited the Natural History Museum which was quite good and you get access to the Peabody museum included. Didn't seem too many (food & drinks) facilties for non students but it was nice to meander around and observe. We enjoyed the John Harvard Statue where local legend has it if you touch his left foot then your IQ will increase; there may be something in this as my wife did and over the next couple of days she did have a couple of very insightful moments!!"

You can visit it too!  Walk into the Emerson hall, which houses the Philosophy department. Walk out of the yard, and visit the Art museum (from Harvard Square entrance, across the yard)  If you have a full day, see if there is an interesting film at Harvard Film Archives (Carpetner Center, practically next to the Art Museum). If you have more than 1 day for a visit, check out Science center, just across the Harvard Yard and many Harvard Museums."

It's easy to get  via the T, just jump on the outbound Red line.  We went a bit too late to get a tour so we walked round the Campus.We started off at the Harvard Business school which is on the Other side of the Charles River (approx 5min from the main campus) and then walked to the Main Campus. For the most part the buildings are of old architecture and definitely give that prestigious vibe. There is a photo opportunity around each corner. I'd say the one downside is you are not able to enter most buildings. We did enter the Law library after asking and I have to say it was breathtaking. I would definitely recommend trying to get into one of the libraries its totally worth it. Overall Harvard is an amazing place. You can make an afternoon of it by grabbing food at Harvard Square."

The tour was quite structured and while we did go inside one of the building a downside was the lack of access to most buildings which are for students only.

We took an unofficial tour that was run by a group of Harvard students (its free, but tips are suggested). The students gave us a very interesting overview of the campus and the history of the university buildings as well as several funny incidents along the way. If you cannot take the tour, a simple walk through the campus is nice to get a feel of the institution. Afterwards a walk through Harvard Square, and a visit to the Harvard Coop is a must."

My first impression was that the campus had some very old buildings, and some of them were closed due to lack of maintenance. It might be there was not enough funding at the time. Recently, I revisited Harvard University, and it completely changed my opinion. I am glad that we made the right decision to learn more about this renowned and historical school. We took the subway to Harvard Square Station and walked to Harvard Information Center in the Holyoke Center Arcade. This was a good start because they offer a free tour of the Harvard Yard, which is led by a senior student. Normally, it has 3 scheduled guided tours (10 am, 12 pm and 2 pm) everyday. It is suggested to check the schedule before you go because it might not have the tours due to various reasons. It is a one-hour walking tour, and it covers most of the campus and its history. You do not need to make a reservation, but sometimes you might need to wait for the next available tour. If you prefer self-guided walking tour, you can visit their mobile tour website.

Harvard University is an American private Ivy League research university which celebrated its 376th anniversary in 2012. It is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. There are many historic buildings in Harvard Yard. The high Victorian Gothic style Memorial Hall is one of the iconic buildings on the campus. It was built in 1870s to honor the Harvard graduates who fought for the Union in the American Civil War. Today, the Sanders Theatre is a lecture and concert hall, and the Annenberg Hall is used as the dining hall for the freshmen. The interior of Memorial Hall is a must see, and you might need to wait in line because it is the most impressive place on the campus. Another interesting location you can’t miss is the John Harvard statue and its “Statue of the Three Lies”. You can easily see his shining shoe because Harvard students and tourists believe rubbing the shoe will bring you luck.

I thought there must have been many directors who use the Harvard campus in their movies. However, I was wrong. Because the movie staff of The Love Story (1970) caused damage to the Harvard campus, the university administration refused most subsequent requests for filming on Harvard."

It is roughly divided into two portions: The Old Yard (western third) and everything else, the latter including the Widener Library and Tercentenary Theater.  I toured here first as part of a group (Hahvahd tours – see separate review) and then the next day on my own with a tour book.  While at first this may look like a “group of old buildings with a statue in the middle” I’m happy to report that looks in this case are quite deceptive.  Many of these buildings are Centuries old and have history dating to the pre-Revolutionary War period;  Massachusetts Hall at different times housed John Adams, John Hancock, Sam Adams, and a contingent of the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.  It seemed at every corner I ran into something historically significant (JFK’s dorm), artistically intriguing (John Harvard’s statue) or both (Holden Chapel).

You won’t be spoon fed information while walking around here (sorry, no fancy descriptive plaques or audio guide) but Harvard Yard is as much an integral part of American history as anything else in New England.  Highly recommended."

They have buildings dating from the 1800s and lots of advances and studies have been made there. Harvard is unusual in the US, as I understand - redbrick buildings laid out in courts and quads and serious people wandering around thinking serious things. 
Unfortunately, I come from the UK, which has both Cambridge and Oxford universities with buildings dating back to the 1400s and older and the whole place just reeks of history, if that's what you're looking for. 
I understand I could have taken a tour, but the tour that was pushed quite heavily around Harvard was (unsurprisingly) the ""alternative and unofficial"" student tour, where you pay a student to tell you about their wacky student lifestyle. I didn't fancy that much either. 

I really can't think of much to recommend about Harvard University. As the title says, if you come from the UK and have been or lived in Cambridge or Oxford, or have visited them, Harvard feels very much like a poor relation. But if you've never been to either, you might find it a bit more interesting. "

From what I understand the group was large compared to what they usually get, it was the high season.  The student spoke loudly and clearly, and was quite amusing.  It was very interesting to hear about each of the building - the tour wasn't as much about the history of Harvard as what happens in each building today, and how life is on campus.  The guide was quite candid in answering questions about why he thinks he got in, how much it cost each year, etc., but would preface every answer by making it clear that it was his own experience.

The tour lasted about an hour and it was interesting throughout.  It is free, but the students are not paid, so the only money they make is from the tips that they get.  We gave our tour guide $10."

Once in the campus, to be honest there is virtually nothing you can go inside of, the university only allows you to walk around outside.  As long as you keep this in mind and appreciate the exterior of the buildings and the squares you will enjoy your visit.
Some buildings not to be missed are the Memorial Hall, the Henry Widener library, the church opposite the library and the John Harvard statue. It's certainly an area to spend some time in, as the buildings are beautiful and very historic. It's a very calm atmosphere to walk around and you could easily spend an hour or 2 appreciating the history."

We were visiting Boston over 5th to 8th July and took the metro to Harvard Uni thinking we would just have a quick wander around with the aid of our guidebook. As we came out of the station there were some harvard students milling around in their distinctive t shirts. Asked if we would like to join the tips only walking tour we decided to do just that. Best idea of the day! Our guide was a third year government law student who was full of enthusiasum, anecdotes, history and a blast to be with. The tour last about 1 1/2 hours and was pretty hard-paced, but you saw such a lot and learnt far more than you would from the guidebooks. Highly recommended. They suggest $10 per person and we were more than happy to hand over our $20 dollars at the end. The tour ends at the student gift shop which is run by the students and all profits are ploughed back into helping students. Prices were very reasonable - much cheaper than in Boston and I managed to get a uni hoodie for my daughter (who is off to uni in the UK soon) for about $15 dollars cheaper than I had saw in Boston. Around the gift shop there are plenty of places to eat and we had a late lunch at a great student pub, again very reasonable.

If you only have a short time to see Harvard I would definitely recommend this walking tour."

My father graduated from Harvard many moons ago and I thought I knew many stories. Gabrielle gave us so much of harvard's history that the general public just does not know. She presented the entire tour as a 'story teller' and really made it all come to life. (I know she said she was an ""English concentrator"", but she sure has a knack for public speaking!) We came home telling my father stories that not even 'he' did not know! The history behind the library is truly a great one.

Next, I hopped across Charles over the Pedestrian Bridge from HBS into Cambridge which led me to Harvard Square. 

Harvard Square is an ideal weekend getaway for students from both Harvard and MIT. And if you get hungry due to the walk, what could be more irresistible than a hot bowl of soup with rich Indian spices at the Bombay Club that I found cuddled in a corner of JFK Street."

The architecture is impressive (although now an amalgam of old and new buildings and styles), and on a good day, sitting on the lawn in front of the Widener Library playing with the squirrels is a stress reducing activity.  It's one of the top universities in the world, and does have that traditional 'sandstone' feel about it.  Because it is a university populated by students though, you might also see some odd sights, as we did the day we were there in January. The sun was out, and the sky was blue, and there was a group of three women in bikinis on the lawn.  Mind you, the temperature was about 3 degrees celsius at the time, so I'm not sure if they were on a dare, and I am sure they wouldn't have stayed there for very long!   Because the campus is so spread out, it's probably not a typical 'tourist' destination, but I would recommend wandering through the campus instead of walking around it if you get the chance.

Во первых, чтобы узнать, а кому-то вспомнить, что американский Кембридж – это другой, не английский Кембридж, и от этого немного разочароваться… Поэтому фраза «бывали мы и в Кембридже», на образованных и подготовленных слушателей особого впечатления не произведет, особенно после уточнения, в каком именно Кембридже вы бывали. Однако у вас будет в запасе ход с козыря, когда вы скажете, что в Кембридж вы поехали, чтобы увидеть Гарвард! Вот это – другое дело! Элитный университет – основная достопримечательность Кембриджа. Осмотрев несколько исторических кирпичных зданий университета, включая Гарвард Холл, Офис Президента, а также университетскую мемориальную церковь, вы сможете говорить «Ну, сами мы Гарвардов не кончали, но все же бывали в Кембридже и видели, как там все устроено…». На самом деле с экскурсией вы увидите снаружи очень малую часть этого гигантского элитного университета, входящего в «Лигу плюща», располагающего более чем двумя тысячами преподавателей и семью тысячами студентов. Среди его выпускников наибольшее в США количество миллиардеров.  Сейчас здесь семь факультетов, которые мы назвали бы гуманитарными.

Muitas pessoas pensam que Harvard é formada apelas pelos prédios em volta da estátua de John Harvard, mas ela é muito maior, é praticamente uma mini cidade. O curioso é que os prédios dos cursos e dormitórios se mesclam com outros estabelecimentos como supermercados e restaurantes, de forma que fica difícil delimitar o campus. Claro que o campus principal é  o da estátua. O visitante pode circular livremente, mas não é permitido entrar nas instalações. Recomendo fazer o tour guiado pelos alunos (custa 12 U$ por pessoa e dura cerca de 2hs e/ou baixar o aplicativo Harvard Yard Tour para ouvir sobre cada uma das construções. Se você curte correr, vale a pena também correr pelo campus do outro lado do rio, perto do Estádio. Fiz isso porque queria conhecer as instalações da Universidade voltadas para negócio e gestão. Enfim, se você é acadêmico ou apenas um admirador dessa que é uma das mais ricas, antigas e influentes universidades do mundo, vale a pena reservar uma manhã ou tarde só para conhecê-la."

Se llega fácilmente con la línea roja del metro, descendiendo en la Harvard Square, justo enfrente de uno de los ingresos al campus, que es totalmente libre. Conviene hacer una visita guiada, previo paso por el centro de visitantes que se halla a 100 metros. Cuando estuvimos nosotros, estas visitas estaban algo restringidas, pero nos proveyeron de un folleto muy didáctico para autoguiarse. El campus principal es un lugar arbolado, tranquilo, de fácil caminata y que transmite un gran clima de estudio y conocimiento. Hay pequeños rincones deliciosos con bancos, donde los alumnos leen o conversan. Algunos sitios sólo están reservados para estudiantes y personal, lo cual es lógico para no entorpecer la vida cotidiana. Aconsejo salirse del campus antiguo y visitar la facultad de ciencias, al otro lado de la calle, un edificio moderno, en el que se pueden ver las aulas, de extraña simpleza, exenta de suntuosidad, que uno puede esperar encontrar en una de las universidades más caras. En algunas es posible incluso ver la actividad de alumnos y docentes. También hay en el hall central una interesantísima exhibición de la evolución del ordenar, desde su origen hasta nuestros días. Por último, nos impresionó la majestuosidad de la Memorial Church. También conviene recorrer algunas calles aledañas del barrio. Toda la actividad dura unas 3/4 horas."

Preferimos ir caminando antes que hacerlo por otros medios y no nos arrepentimos. Tomamos la Cambridge St desde estación Lechmere y (la verdad valió la pena) disfrutamos del paisaje urbano muy pintoresco.
El campus es un lugar muy bonito lleno de edificaciones de diverso diseño y tamaño, en medio de grandes árboles y con muchos senderos por donde no dejan de pasar estudiantes y profesores. Se siente el ambiente estudiantil y, a la vez, se percibe un aire de tarde de domingo por lo silencioso del lugar.

5月のボストンは暖かく少し暑いくらいで、とても過ごしやすい上に景色が美しく本当に帰るのが嫌になりました。笑
またハーバード大学も緑豊かで青天に緑、ベージュの校舎が絵に描いたような美しさでとても印象的でした。
一般人も入れる上に、ハーバード像の脚を撫でるとハーバード大学に合格出来るというジンクス？があるようでハーバード大学入学希望者らしき若者たちで溢れています。
ただし、中国人や韓国人の下品な行動も目立ち不快な部分も多々ありました。
でもやはり、5月のボストンはとても美しいので是非ハーバード像の脚を触りに行ってみては？？(^ ^)
ちなみにボストンの地下鉄は主要観光スポットへのアクセスがとても良いので地下鉄に乗るのをお勧めします。
1回券では2.75💲？だかと割高ですが、1日券券を購入すると20💲くらいで乗り放題です。
ボストン地下鉄の凄いところは日本のように1日券（購入したその日だけ）ではなく、購入した時間から24時間有効という、本当の1日券なんです！笑
是非ボストンでは1日券の地下鉄キップの購入をお勧めします！"

Fiquei imaginando o orgulho de se estudar lá. É uma pena não poder visitar o interior destes edifícios ( não sei se é sempre assim , mas no momento da nossa visita os alunos estavam em prova e não nos permitiram o acesso ). Mesmo assim, valeu muito a pena , pois o lugar é lindo, encantador, digno de belas fotos. Para aqueles que gostam de mais informações , há um tour guiado pelos próprios alunos que parte da Harvard Square. Ao redor do campus há muitas lojinhas com souvenirs da universidade.
Não  deixe de conhecer, de Boston o acesso é fácil , linha vermelha do metrô sentido Alewife, desça na estação Harvard e você já sairá na Harvard Square. Transporte curto e rápido. Na volta aproveite para conhecer o MIT, é só descer na estação Kendall/MIT."

Logo de cara, além de todo seu prestígio, a universidade se destaca pelas grandiosas estruturas em tijolinhos vermelhos (que aliás, é bem típico de toda a região de Massachusetts), e que tem grandes chances de lhe parecer bem familiar por já ter sido cenário de diversos filmes como Garoto Indomável, O Amor de um Pai e o óbvio A Rede Social, que conta a história de Mark Zuckerberg e a criação do Facebook ali mesmo, dentro daquelas paredes de tijolinhos!

Além de Zuckerberg e grandes figuras histórias, outras personalidades ainda atuantes nos dias de hoje também estudaram por ali: Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Gates, os atores Tommy Lee Jones e Matt Damon e a atriz Natalie Portman. (Curiosamente nem Hillary Clinton nem Donald Trump estão nessa prestigiada lista!) #abafa :-)"

我们来到约翰·哈佛的铜像前合影，他左脚的靴子因为经常被摸而油光锃亮。据说多摸这只脚就可以考上哈佛，这个雕塑也被称为“三谎言”雕塑。因为铜像基座上刻着如下文字：“约翰·哈佛，创立者，1638。”就这三行字，却构成了哈佛最著名的三大谎言。第一，这个雕塑并不是哈佛本人而是哈佛大学的一名叫做谢尔曼·霍尔的学生；第二，哈佛本人并非哈佛大学的创建者，而是一位在临终前将自己的一半遗产和所有图书捐给哈佛大学的牧师；第三，哈佛大学成立于1636年而不是1638年。之后又在周边逛了逛，各个学科的学院散落在不同的地点。由于天气寒冷，学生们都步履匆匆，只有参观者兴致盎然，摆拍不断。"

Nel nostro caso, essendo in quattro, la scelta più ragionevole è stata il taxi, che ci ha fruttato anche una bella chiacchierata con un giovane tassista etiope.
Abbiamo affrontato la visita approfittando dei tour informativi generali guidati dagli studenti (in inglese, dove la principale difficoltà di comprensione sta nel fatto che le descrizioni sono snocciolate all'aperto e subiscono quindi tutti i disturbi ambientali dovuti al traffico, agli onnipresenti lavori in corso, ecc., ma rimangono sufficientemente fruibili e ricchi di aneddoti e informazioni), il che ci ha permesso di apprezzare la notevole estensione del campus e l'atmosfera di relax che ne domina il parco.
Purtroppo le strutture non sono visitabili all'interno, tuttavia l'Harvard Yard ha un sapore architettonicamente molto tradizionale.
Giusti per fare qualche confronto, a fronte delle nostre domande abbiamo capito che si tratta di corsi che hanno un costo paragonabile alle più prestigiose università italiane e anche il percorso accademico e l'impostazione dei corsi è abbastanza in linea con la nostra. La differenza più evidente rimane proprio la vita nel campus, che è la formula largamente preferita di frequenza e per molti ragazzi rappresenta anche il distacco dalla famiglia (no bamboccioni ...).
Se siete interessati al merchandising, al di là del piccolo store attiguo all'information center, segnalo la presenza di un bellissimo negozio (Harvard Coop) con uno sterminato assortimento e prezzi in linea, quindi non popolari."

Le terrain entre les 2 bâtiments, c'est le Tercentenary Theater -- là où sont alignées toutes les chaises blanches des étudiants et parents lors de la graduation annuelle lors de la remise des diplômes. 

Cela fait le tour des bâtiments important à l'intérieur de l'enceinte même ... tout le reste est bâti autour : 

- Fogg Art Museum où on peut admirer plusieurs toiles de Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, Renoir & Degas 

- Memorial Hall (1870) -- centre communautaire pour étudiants de 1e année, Avec son allure de cathédrale gothique, elle se veut un hommage en mémoire des diplômés tués au combat de la guerre de sécession.

- Caserne de pompier de Cambridge desservant Harvard.

- Harvard Museum of Natural History 

... et plein d'autres choses à voir. Tout cela fait partie le l'université Harvard

Quelques célébrités ont fréquenté Harvard : Tommy Lee Jones, Mira Sorvino & Natalie Portman, pour en nommer quelques uns"

地名がケンブリッジですが、ケンブリッジ大学はイギリスの大学です。敷地内は大学なので基本オープンですが、建物内は観光客が歩いていい場所とも思えないので入りませんでした。「ハーバード自然史博物館」というところは入場料を払えば入れますが、カエルやライオンの写真ディスプレイを見てやめました。(そっち系には興味はないので)　でも歴史ある建物としては入ってみるのもいいかもしれません。
行ったのが9月初旬の土曜日でしたが、ハーバードに行くまでに大きなソファーを2人がかりで運んでいる若者を2組ぐらい見ました。なんで??と思ったのですが、理由は学内に入ってわかりました。不用品のフリマをやっていたようで、ソファーも売ってましたし、まがった針金ハンガーまで売ってました。ほかにも博物館前の芝生でコンパ(?)みたいなのをしてたり、学生さんの生活の一端を見れたようでとても面白かったです。
帰りの飛行機で映画ソーシャル・ネットワークを見たのですが、実際にハーバード大学を見てみると「なるほど」と納得させられるところが多かったです。良家の子女が入る有名大学に紛れ込んだ天才プログラマーの悲劇というか、厄介ごとというか、映画のあらすじでは見えにくい厳然としたエリート意識というものに実際のハーバード大学の雰囲気を見て気づかされました。よくできた映画だと思います。
さて、お土産は大学内では見つからなかったので、ハーバード・スクエア駅近くのThe Harvard Coop(本屋さんですが)でHarvardの文字の入ったTシャツを買いました。バッグにはMITのコープでもあるように書かれていましたが、MIT系のグッズは見当たりませんでした。基本は本屋さんなので、別の観光地で売っている提携グッズを探す方が効率はいいかもしれません。もちろん本はいっぱいあります。(基本英語ですが)"

Кто лежит на траве, кто развалился на стульях, а кто сидит в выемках зданий.Суету создают только туристы, которые фотографируются с памятником Гарварда или шумно кормят белок. Очень было приятно прогуляться и впитать аромат знаний. Когда мы вышли за территорию, то нырнули в типичный полуподвальный местный бар, где в скромной обстановке отведали пиццу с пивом и под звуки американского футбола, которые доносились с ТВ на стене, обсудили прелестный городок Кембридж."

Harvard dan MIT persisnya berlokasi di kota yang sama, yakni Cambridge (walaupun banyak yang mengira berlokasi di Boston, karena Cambridge merupakan kota kecil berseberangan sungai dengan Boston).  Sebagai universitas tua, tentu banyak bangunan tua yang menarik untuk dilihat di kampus universitas ini.  Jarak antara Harvard dan MIT sangat dekat, berada dalam satu jalur subway (red line), hanya terpisah oleh satu stasiun saja.  Harvard dan MIT merupakan seteru abadi, namun persaingan yang sehat menyebabkan kedua universitas ini sama-sama maju pesat.

Jika anda berharap menemukan gedung-gedung ultra mewah di kampus ini, maka anda akan kecewa, karena gedung-gedung di kampus Harvard merupakan tipikal universitas tua di Amerika Serikat.  Kehebatan Harvard bukan pada fisik gedungnya, tetapi dari apa yang dihasilkan dari kegiatan akademiknya.  Harvard telah melahirkan 47 pemenang Nobel, 48 pemenang Pulitzer, dan 32 kepala negara.

Komposisi mahasiswanya juga sangat berbeda dengan perguruan tinggi di negara berkembang, termasuk Indonesia.  Di Harvard, jumlah mahasiswa S1 (undergraduate) sedikit, sekitar 6.700 orang saja, tetapi mahasiswa S2 dan S3 (graduate) mencapai 14.500 orang.  Ini merupakan salah satu ciri universitas riset. Kalau ingin memahami bagaimana perguruan tinggi seharusnya dikelola, maka Harvard bisa menjadi model yang bagus."

letta per la prima volta la dichiarazione dell'indipendenza, piazzetta , casa, e balconcino esistono
tutt'ora.
In questa meravigliosa città che in alcuni luoghi assomiglia a Londra siamo andati a visitare
la famosa  università di John Harvard , fondata dall'omonimo prete nel 1630 .
Già l'entrata principale è piuttosto pomposa , e con tanto di stemma, poi proseguendo
all'interno si notano edifici d'epoca fatti con mattoni d'argilla rossa, molto belli a dire il vero,
e poi quelli più nuovi non altrettanto belli , quello che mi ha colpito era lo spazio verde che
c'era, molti prati verdi, zone ricreative, e moltissimi giovani di tutte le parti del mondo che se la godevano giocando tra di loro, veramente un bel vedere.
Il refettorio è ricavato da una bella vecchia grande chiesa, in mattoni rossi naturalmente, siamo entrati e c'era abbastanza baccano, centinaia di studenti erano intenti chi a mangiare, chi a chiacchierare chi a  cantare, ci venne subito incontro l'addetto alla sicurezza il quale con molto
garbo disse a me e mia moglie che non potevamo rimanere dentro la chiesa/refettorio.
Continuammo il nostro giro ed entrando da una porta aperta salimmo le scale belle pulite 
bianche silenziosissime, e ci trovammo al secondo piano nientepopodimeno che in direzione ,
anche li trovammo 2 segretarie le quali molto gentilmente ci dissero che non potevamo stare .
Ce da dire che noi impersonavamo perfettamente i turisti sulla cinquantina con tanto di macchina fotografica ciondoloni venuti da molto lontano, per ammirare quel popò di università.
Ci dirigemmo verso il self service , molto grande , e con diversi punti di vendita come pizzeria,
cafeteria, ecc. ecc.  il nome della pizzeria era errato,  "" Bella  Boca "" noi lo facemmo presente
e ci dissero che l'avrebbero corretto, in un'altra struttura visitammo le aule , le quali  segnalazioni 
erano alfanumeriche, non molto grandi a dire il vero, max 150 persone, li nessuno ci disse nulla,
entrammo tranquillamente nelle aule e guardammo .
Dopo aver molto gentilmente ed educatamente rotto un po' le scatole a tutti attraversammo il
parco verso il monumento al prete  John Harvard il quale ha il piede sinistro completamente
levigato per il fatto che tutti appoggiano le mani su quel piede per farsi la foto, me compreso.
Ha un certo fascino la galleria  dei ""famosi "" , le quali targhe all'interno portano incisi nomi
e cognomi di personaggi che hanno fatto la storia degli Stati Uniti, caratteristiche le fontanelle di legno dove abbeverarsi.

Hay varias formas de llegar hasta esta facultad. Hay que tener en cuenta que el sistema de transporte en esta ciudad es muy bueno y seguro.
Nosotros tomamos un Tour en español de la empresa Don Quijote sacamos los datos de una revista del Hotel. 
Paso la pagina por si les interesa http://www.tourboston.com/
Este Tour nos llevo entre varios sitios a la Universidad.
El Guia nos acompaño para ver desde afuera una clase , fue interesante la experiencia, ver a los estudiantes en clase,  Caminamos por el barrio que la rodea, que es donde viven los estudiantes vimos sus casas y los comercios de la zona, tanto las casas como la onda de los bares no es como uno se lo imaginaria , es mas bien precario, casual no muy elegante y se puede ver las casitas un tanto desordenadas des prolijas,
Ademas de bares también hay las típicas tiendas de recuerdo.
Los estudiantes te pasan por al lado como si no vieran al turismo deben estar acostumbrados a que la gente los visite como peces. Uno los puede ver apresurados y en su mundo.
A diferencia de la UCLA aqui los estudiantes se ven mas arreglados, serios y menos distraídos
También se puede observar la casa donde vivieron presidentes en su época de estudiantes y hasta un Bill Gates. Fue muy útil la explicación en español del guía del Tour.
Aprendimos tambien que tienen su propia policia y su propio banco. Muy Intersante todo. Vale la pena ir."

Altrettanto sbaglia chi restasse deluso perchè non può visitare nessun edificio: assicuro che le aule di Harvard, le sue biblioteche, i laboratori, i dormitori sono esattamente come quelli di quasi tutte le circa 3.300 università degli Stati Uniti, anzi, alcune ne hanno di migliori. Di diverso, Harvard ha la storia e il valore: a testimonianza dell'importanza attribuita all'educazione, Harvard è stata fondata dai Padri Pellegrini nel 1636, solo 15 anni dopo il loro sbarco sulle coste del Massachusetts. Il suo nome ricorda un oscuro pastore protestante morto a poco più di 30 anni, che lasciò a una scuola già esistente il patrimonio dei suoi 2.000 libri. Grazie all'impegno e alla dedizione profusi negli ultimi 300 anni dal personale docente e non docente, Harvard è diventata la prima Università al mondo o comunque una delle prime due al mondo. Il modello didattico prevede l'elevatissima qualità dell'insegnamento (molti professori sono premi Nobel), l'applicazione di criteri di valutazione meritocratici, rigore, ordine e severità. I risultati? Da Harvard sono usciti i Presidenti americani Theodore Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Barack Obama, il VIce Presidente Al Gore, un numero impressionante di presidenti canadesi e latino americani, il Premier israeliano Netanyahu e poi BIll Gates, l'Aga Khan e pure un tal Kaszinsky, meglio noto come ""Unabomber"" (forse una difettosità nei criteri di selezione all'ingresso?). Non tutti i laureati ad Harvard si sono buttati in politica o negli affari: Jack Lemmon, Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Natalie Portman a altri hanno fatto del cinema, Mark Zuckerberg ha inventato Facebook e Jeremy Lin è una stella dei New York Knickerborkers di basket. Sorvolo sulla ventina di istituti di ricerca, sui PhD, sui Master: quelli potete guardarveli nel sito dell'Università. Se si sa cosa è Harvard, aggirarsi tra gli edifici del campus o guardare la statua di John Harvard regala la stessa emozione che si può provare entrando in un santuario. Questo ovviamente è un santuario laico, tutto dedicato alla cultura."

Im Rahmen dieser Führungen, die von Studenten der Universität durchgeführt werden, erfahren die Gäste ´ne Menge aus dem Alltag des studentischen Leben und sehr interessante Informationen, die die Universität betreffen. Der Campus der Harvard Universität ist wunderschön gestaltet, so dass die Studenten und Gäste bzw. Besucher der Universität dort zumindest bei schönem Wetter verweilen, sich erholen und die schöne Umgebung genießen können."

Sicher nicht ganz einfach da einen Parkplatz zu finden, aber wenn man den hat kann man den Spirit von dieser altehrwürdigen University richtig spüren. Allein schon das schlendern über den Campus ist sehr schön. Die Blicke fallen recht schnell auf die prächtigen roten Bauten mit den Treppen wo die Abschlüsse der Studenten gefeiert, oder wie in unserem Fall besungen werden. Das sollte man sich nicht entgehen lassen."

Alles ist super gepflegt, eine first class Kantine, top Ausstattung und dazu ein Ambiente, das zum Nachdenken und Studieren anregt. Sehr inspirierend. Habe mich dort einen ganzen Tag umgeschaut und mir ist nicht langweilig geworden. Wenn man in Boston ist, dann unbedingt anschauen."

Es werden zwei unterschiedliche Führungen angeboten, eine offizielle und die inoffizielle ""Hahvahd"" Tour, welche beide von Studenten der Uni gemacht werden. Wir entschieden uns für die kostenlose offizielle, bei der Hahvahd Tour, die als humoristischer beschrieben wird,  bittet man um eine Spende. Leider war die Führung sehr stark besucht, ca. 40-50 Leute und unser Führer war relativ schwer zu verstehen (trotz relativ guten Englischkenntnissen), da er sehr schnell und undeutlich gesprochen hat. Zudem konnten alle Gebäude nur von außen betrachtet werden und waren wenig aussagekräftig über die eigentliche Universität. 
Insgesamt ist ein Besuch der Uni zu empfehlen, einfach weil es die Berühmteste der Welt ist, von der offiziellen Führung ist mit Schulenglisch eher abzuraten."

ich habe ein Jahr an der Harvard Law School studiert und kenne mich daher in Boston gut aus. Ich kann jedem, der sich in der Gegend aufhält nur dringend empfehlen, wenigstens eine STunde am Campus der Harvard University vorbeizuschauen (einfach T neben bis ""Harvard Square""). Besonders sehenswert ist die Law SChool, aber auch die Business School, wobei letztere etwas weiter weg liegt (nach Süden). 
Anschauen v.a: Harvard Statue; Weidner Library; Law School Library (Langdell).
Viel Spass!"
