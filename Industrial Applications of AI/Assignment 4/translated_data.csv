Reverend John Harvard, who bequeathed his entire library and half of his estate, is the University's namesake. Just 16 years following the landing of the Pilgrims, the original focus of Harvard University was to educate Christian clergy with its motto ""Truth for Christ and the Church"". Presidents, billionaires and Rhodes Scholars are only some of the illustrious graduates. The historic tree covered grounds with brick architecture are worthy of tour. The Gothic-Revival Memorial Hall/Lowell Complex was constructed in the 1870's to honor those men who served in the Civil War. Do enter this majestic building and view the colorful and stunning stained-glass windows, by both prominent artisans: Tiffany and LaFarge.

Stroll past the 1916 Widener Library, the largest of Harvard's dozens of libraries, and don't miss the Memorial Church with its lovely light interior. We took the MBTA Red Line which delivered us to the Harvard Square Station. Easy, quick, convenient and inexpensive, this is a great means of travel.

One abiding memory is a throng of Japanese tourists walking around with selfie sticks snapping photos of themselves. Nevertheless, this is America's oldest university, and one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, with a long line of notable alumni, as noted by other reviewers. This is evidenced by the number of writers, thinkers, and Nobel laurates to have studied here, reflected in the subtle academic vibe exhibited by the students and staff, passing through the central courtyard where commencement is held. 

This area is surrounded by a number of famous and historic buildings - the Widener Library, Harvard Memorial Church and both the white granite University Hall and Sever Hall. The landmark John Harvard statue, sitting on a 6 foot granite plinth, is located outside University Hall facing both Harvard and Massachusetts Halls, and the Johnston Gate. Audio files of historical information on each of the buildings in Harvard Yard can be downloaded. It is good that visitors are welcome to roam freely around the campus of this famous university and see how it feels to be on this campus.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is housed in the University Museum Building, and the affiliated Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is located at Divinity Avenue on the campus. This is a very active university, so, of necessity, there is limited access during academic sessions. We didn‚Äôt go on any of the guided tours but did avail of the tour pamphlets at the tour office.

It's Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the oldest and richest and most prestigious university in the United States. Established in 1636 and located about 3 miles northwest of Boston, it is a private Ivy League research university whose history, influence and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities. Its $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution. Its library, the world's largest academic and private library system, comprises 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Its alumni include eight U.S. Presidents, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars and 130 Nobel Laureates. Impressed? My wife and I were visiting Boston for the first time and a trip to Harvard was a no-brainer. I wanted to see Harvard Stadium, home of the Harvard-Yale football game that dates to 1875. And I wanted to see Harvard Yard, the oldest part of the Harvard campus, its historic center and its crossroads. Bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge Street, Broadway and Quincy Street, the grassy area of 22.4 acres enclosed by fence with 27 gates contains most of the freshman dormitories, the school's most important libraries, Memorial Church, several classroom and departmental buildings and the offices of the Dean of Harvard College and President of Harvard College. So how do you see it all. You can't. For example, there are 20 museums of culture, science and digital collections on campus, including Harvard Art Museum, Arnold Arboretum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard Museum of Natural History and Harvard Museums of Science and Culture. The business school and athletic facilities, including Harvard Stadium, are located across the Charles River in the Allston neighborhood of Boston. We started at the Welcome to Harvard Information Center at the Smith Campus Center, 30 Dunster Street, in Cambridge. Established in 1962, its mission is to serve as the ""front door"" to Harvard by providing historic and general information about the  campus. We arranged for a self-guided walking and driving tour of Harvard Yard and Harvard Stadium. But visitors can choose a student-led public walking tour or group tour for 15 or more people or private tour or audio tour or mobile tour, whatever suits your time and fancy.

By the way, I don't say I envied of Harvard, having been a professor myself at a humbler university back in my place for sometime. You made my day and thank you very much. "

Harvard Yard spans 22 grassy acres & is enclosed by fences & gates.  The 5,500 sq. ft. Harvard Book Store faces the Yard.

The center courtyard where commencement is held is surrounded by University Hall, Sever Hall, the Widener Library, & Harvard Memorial Church.  

The John Harvard statue rests on a foundation outside the white granite University Hall.  

There are colorful chairs under the trees that provide shade for those who wish to read, eat, or rest.  Everything about the Harvard environment is inspiring.  An understated aesthetic vibe runs through it that's hard to define but genuine.

Take a walk through the yard, where all Harvard Freshman spend a year before being sorted into a house for the remaining three years, unless they join a social club or elect to live off campus. While in the yard, peek into memorial chapel - one of the few buildings open to the public.

Next, visit the Harvard Art Museum. The collections in this new museum are world class.

You also should check out the glass flowers at the Museum of Natural History - they are legendary. 

Make sure to take a quick walk through the Radcliffe Yard, which is across the Cambridge Common. It contains some of Harvard's oldest buildings.

The ART American Repatory Theater may have a show playing. Check ahead and build you visit around one. Many have gone to Broadway after being shaken down in this famed theater. 

Down the street form the ART is the famed home of poet Longfellow. If you like to walk. Continue down Brattle street away from the square. The homes are the finest in Cambridge. Also, the Mt. Auburn cemetery is also a favorite. 

Hungry, well your in luck. Italian, think Toscano or Benadetto. Burgers, go strait to BARTLEY'S. If not open, Tastey Burger or Shake Shack will hit the spot. Brunch, Henriettas table #1 and tres cher. If looking for affordable brunch, hit Park on lower JFK Street, excellent food a la cart. American Bistro, Harvest. French, Les Sablons. Both are fantastic. Want Hip with music most evenings, Beat Hotel. Finally, if you want over the top Mexican and it's cheap! Felipes is tour place. Drinks upstairs on the deck can be lots of fun during the warmer months, but arrive early or be prepared to wait for a while. Don't be scared off by the lines - they move quickly.

If your early and want breakfast, Darwins or Flour and on Mt. Auburn and Crema on the corner of Brattle are all popular with us locals. Do get a cup of hot chocolate in the winter - L.A.Burdicks - don't miss this opportunity on a cold day. Think thick delcious melting chocolate you can drink.

6. Walk across the river to the business school and look at the high temple of american corporate craziness. See if you can get into the cafeteria (called Spangler Hall, if I recall correctly). It's nuts.

7. Do the standard tour. It's part of the show.

8. Hang out in Harvard Square. Aside from studying, that's pretty much what the students do..."

2016-07-04 16:38:08+00:00,Mobile,4,1,DIY walking tour in Cambridge ,"I stayed at Boston Park Plaza near Public Garden, and form there I walked over to Harvard University. The thing I enjoy most when visiting a new place is just walking around to really see and experience the area. From my hotel to Harvard, it was a   an-hour-and-12-minute walk, according to Google Maps. If you are an urban hiker and are OK walking this kind of distance like me, read on!

From Public Garden, there are many streets running parallel to one another. I walked on all of them and the Esplanade toward Harvard Bridge. They are all charming. Newbury offers high-end shopping and the view of the Charles River walking along the Esplanade is wonderful. 

After crossing Harvard Bridge, you see MIT. I visited on the 4th of July, so unfortunately everything was closed. Otherwise, I would have been interested in visiting MIT Museum. After seeing MIT, stay on Massachusetts Avenue no matter what Google Maps says. I typed in Harvard University as my destination, and really got lost. So try some other destination or just stay on Massachusetts till you see Harvard. 

The area surrounding the University is very charming, with lots of eateries and shops. The red brick campus is, of course, worth a visit. Now, here's one of the highlights of my walking tour:

Whenever I plan a walking tour like this,  especially on Sunday or major holidays, I really worry about whether or not there are any toilets along the way. ( Harvard and MIT are universities, not amusement parks, people! ). I did some search and found a very recent article saying ""the very first public bathroom in the Harvard area made a ""grand opening"" in February, 2016!  The article sounded like the appropriateness of putting a public loo right in front of Harvard was controversial for many reasons. I was so curious I went to find it, and to see if it's really there.

The bathroom was very clean and  spacious, and very good-looking. Only one stall. For those who go to a bathroom twice a day, it might be laughable for me to write this much about one. But for others, it is an important issue. If I hadn't stumbled on the article about this new addition to the area, I probably would have visited Aquarium on the 4th. 

So, to whomever came up to this idea and made it happen, thank you very much. I really enjoyed visiting Cambridge on Independence Day, 2016.

The hanging out version:

Breath the culture, mingle with the students, start conversations, ask what people like, sit just down and enjoy the atmosphere, stroll around not missing out the library building offering you the exposer to a lot of very individual persons, who for instance just occupy the benches, hang out in the internet, stretch out and sleep or talk with you cause you seem to have time. Like that you'll spend a jolly day and remember for ever Harvard was a place feeling you good.

Making a museums tour version:

You can of course also book or make a tour for instance and you gonna meet the 
Harvard Museum of Natural History, Harvard University Herbaria, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Harvard Universitria and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum and if you've swallowed it all, you may remember Harvard is a place making you smart. Such tours can be booked in local tourist agencies and will cost you about 20 dollars (Jan 2016)

Exploring the surroundings version:

Of course even in times of Netflix and Spotify the students love to meet somewhere and getting entertained. Meaning after looking around and enjoying little caf√©s and bars offering healthy stuff (naturally raised chicken making the premium price of your Caesar Salad for instance) you will find a number of local clubs, to hang out and listen to some good music, playing chess or back gammon in public or dare to sit down and show off playing master mind - just because you may feel so much inspired.

As I had only about 2 hours to spend at Harvard University, I decided I could get a glimpse of some of the highlights of Harvard University by attending one of the Official Harvard Tour.

The Official Harvard Tour has its earliest tour of the day start at 10 a.m. As I was in Harvard area very early, I signed up for the tour way before 9.30 a.m. I subsequently learnt that it was helpful to be early to sign up for the Official Harvard Tour. The tours were so popular that the 10 a.m. tour was fully booked before 9.45 a.m. However, as registration starts only one hour before a designated tour, it does help to plan ahead the visit to the Harvard Events and Information Center in Holyoke Center so as to secure a place on the Official Harvard Tour.

The Official Harvard Tour was led by one of the student volunteers. In addition to attending the Official Harvard Tour, I bought myself a copy of ""A self-guided walking tour of Harvard Yard and surrounding areas"".

The Official Harvard Tour brought us to various locations on Harvard Yard such as the Massachusetts Hall, the Harvard Hall, the Science Center, the Memorial Hall, the Widener Library and the site of the John Harvard Statue.

I love the spaciousness of Harvard Yard, and it was a lovely experience being there on a day in summer.

During the tour, I learnt that the Memorial Hall is the building whereby first-year students of Harvard would dine in so as to foster a sense of community. The Massachusetts Hall is the oldest building that is still standing at Harvard. I felt privileged to be visiting Harvard University which has a long history.

It would be nice to offer a gratuity at the end of the tour.

Upon arrival, we were impressed with the campus, with satellite kind of clusters among academic schools, hostels, retail and F&B outlets, among many others. We were also attracted to the various red-brick buildings. They were very nice and magnificent and solely the property of the University. In deed, this place was just like a mini-town by itself and its full of energy, vibe and activities on going.

We walked around the campus and soon we came by the most visited place in the campus. The statue of the sitting ""Mr Harvard"". Many people came forward to be photographed and touching the ""leg"" and hopefully their children/grandchildren will be blessed to be as smart. Haha, a myth? Anyway, just to clarify that this person was not Mr Harvard (the founder of the institution) himself. As in those days, the university was unable to find a photo of Mr Harvard himself when erecting a monument in honour of him, it organized a contest to look for the ""most good looking"" person and selected the winner to have the monument made after him. So this ""Mr Harvard"" was handsome. This story was shared to us by our guide.

The campus was lovely and serene, with buildings surrounding greenery landscape and with chairs and benches around for students or visitors to sit and rest while enjoying the beauty of the campus. There was a train station in the campus, besides many nice architectural buildings like churches as well.

So we walked around the campus with a feeling of being a ""Harvard"" student and somehow feel ""proud"" to be one as the university is world ranked Number 1.

We came by the campus circle where eateries, cafes and retail shops were located and had our breakfast there. People here were orderly and well mannered and polite. Prices here were reasonable and cheaper than elsewhere. Thereafter, we walked around the gift and book stores nearby, grabbing up some books and souvenirs.

Finally, we landed at the Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences where I caught up with my associate for a while. Visited briefly on the LTs as well and was briefed about the history of the university and the years of transformation. I was then led to the Co-op store, ran by the students on vacation and bought some gift items as well as a form of support.

It was a lovely walk-around trip in Harvard university in Cambridge in Boston. The feeling was so closed to heart, perhaps due to the fact that I am an academic too.

The station name is ""Harvard"" and it brings you right to the famous Harvard Square. We joined a Student-Led Tour that departed from the Harvard Information Center, in the Smith Campus Center.

It was a walking tour of adult tourists not students. Our student leader was Jimmy. He was very familiar with the campus history, facts and details of the buildings interjected with lots of personal antidotes. Very enjoyable, personable and interesting young man.

We enjoyed the wonderful warm fall day and toured the following: Harvard Yard, Freshman dorms, Tercentenacy Theater, Widener Library, Memorial Hall, a Science centre, the John Harvard Statue and more. We did not enter any of the buildings except for the Memorial Hall. The building are amazing...red brick, some 300 years old. There are mature trees and wonderful roof lines to admire as well as steeples and grassy slopes. The architecture was striking...with a mix of traditional striped roofs and modern glass buildings from the 1070s.

After completing the tour we ambled around the campus to look at the Harvard Lampoon building. A quirky building with a smiling mouth and eyes. We recommend wandering the campus and enjoying all the free statues and the heritage buildings with their dormer windows. Breathtakingly Beautiful!

If you have time and the weather is fair, I recommend a short walk along the Charles River for a look at the buildings and bridges

Being tourists, we also stopped into the Coop store for some retail therapy. Lots of Harvard souvenirs to be purchased!

The Harvard yard itself (open and free of charge to visit) is rather impressing, with old buildings where lots of old presidents and other famous business people and celebrities have waked the corridors. Having been to Cambridge (England) and stayed in a college dorm room there for a short while, I was maybe not as hugely impressed with the Harvard campus as I otherwise would have been, yet it is indeed a place where it's well worth spending a few hours."

The guide also was required to walk backwards which was very disconcerting and I felt that I had to watch out for her in case she would walk into something/someone.

A great half day activity that doesn't break the bank. Take the 15-20 minute subway trip out to Cambridge and take the Student lead tour through Harvard University. The cost of the trip is $10.00 and money well spent. The tour company is run by Harvard University students and all the proceeds go back to the students. The tour start is located at the main exit  from Cambridge Subway. You will be meet by a person who will direct you to a small newspaper stand where you pay your money and get your ticket.  You then take your ticket back to the person who then gives you a sticker. It is a little round about but it works.

Our tour guide was a third student who was 5 foot and 1 inch tall named Brett (This is how he introduced himself). He was a pocket rocket, he was very enthusiastic about showing the group around, telling great stories of the going on's of the students, pointing out where famous graduates or 'non graduates' lived and studied and informing the group of the history of America's oldest university. The tour is two hours long and finishes at a park just outside the university walls. There is a great cafe located here for lunch and just around the corner is the subway for the trip back to Boston.

We could not get into the library without an ID. I understand how exclusive the school is but they still have to be competitive.

My father graduated from Harvard many moons ago and I thought I knew many stories. Gabrielle gave us so much of harvard's history that the general public just does not know. She presented the entire tour as a 'story teller' and really made it all come to life. (I know she said she was an ""English concentrator"", but she sure has a knack for public speaking!)

La visita pu√≤ essere effettuata da soli o accompagnati da matricole al prezzo di 10$ circa. Noi abbiamo effettuato la visita con uno studente molto simpatico, capace di intrattenervi per tutto il tempo a patto che capiate molto bene l'inglese in quanto gli Americani parlano molto veloce ed a Boston mangiano un po' le parole. La visita √® stata molto piacevole, l'atmosfera all'interno del campus √® incredibile. Se dovessi valutare solamente il luogo darei sicuramente il massimo del punteggio ma ci sono state delle cose che non sono piaciute: partendo dal fatto che siamo nell'universit√† pi√π prestigiosa del mondo e che gli studenti, anche quelli '' meno facoltosi''' provengono da classi molto agiate della societ√†, trovo assurdo il continuo far riferimento al gift shop e alle mance da dover lasciare agli studenti che vi accompagnano.

The visit can be done on your own or accompanied by freshmen for about $10. We made the visit with a very nice student, able to entertain you the whole time as long as you understand English very well as Americans speak very fast and in Boston they eat their words a bit. The visit was very pleasant, the atmosphere inside the campus is incredible. If I had to evaluate only the place I would definitely give it top marks but there were some things that I did not like: starting with the fact that we are in the most prestigious university in the world and that the students, even the '' less wealthy'' ones come from very affluent classes of society, I find absurd the constant reference to the gift shop and the tips you have to leave for the students accompanying you."

Just in front, you can see people having their photo taken in front of the statue of John Harvard. His bronze foot is gleaming from friction.

We wandered around the campus, as no indoor visits are allowed.

Several U.S. presidents and Nobel Prize winners have visited here.

We really enjoyed this visit, this moment of relaxation, calm and nature."

2017-05-26 09:30:51+00:00,Mobile,4,10,Imperdible visita estando en Boston,"Si est√°s en Boston, debes ir de visita al campus de la Universidad de Harvard. Se llega f√°cilmente con la l√≠nea roja del metro, descendiendo en la Harvard Square, justo enfrente de uno de los ingresos al campus, que es totalmente libre. Conviene hacer una visita guiada, previo paso por el centro de visitantes que se halla a 100 metros. Cuando estuvimos nosotros, estas visitas estaban algo restringidas, pero nos proveyeron de un folleto muy did√°ctico para autoguiarse. El campus principal es un lugar arbolado, tranquilo, de f√°cil caminata y que transmite un gran clima de estudio y conocimiento. Hay peque√±os rincones deliciosos con bancos, donde los alumnos leen o conversan. Algunos sitios s√≥lo est√°n reservados para estudiantes y personal, lo cual es l√≥gico para no entorpecer la vida cotidiana. Aconsejo salirse del campus antiguo y visitar la facultad de ciencias, al otro lado de la calle, un edificio moderno, en el que se pueden ver las aulas, de extra√±a simpleza, exenta de suntuosidad, que uno puede esperar encontrar en una de las universidades m√°s caras. En algunas es posible incluso ver la actividad de alumnos y docentes. Tambi√©n hay en el hall central una interesant√≠sima exhibici√≥n de la evoluci√≥n del ordenar, desde su origen hasta nuestros d√≠as. Por √∫ltimo, nos impresion√≥ la majestuosidad de la Memorial Church. Tambi√©n conviene recorrer algunas calles aleda√±as del barrio. Toda la actividad dura unas 3/4 horas.",4,26,5,2017,UTC,es,1436,"If you are in Boston, you must visit the Harvard University campus. It is easily reached on the red line of the subway, getting off at Harvard Square, right in front of one of the entrances to the campus, which is completely free. It is advisable to take a guided tour, after passing through the visitor center, which is 100 meters away. When we were there, these tours were somewhat restricted, but we were provided with a very didactic brochure for self-guiding. The main campus is wooded, quiet, easy to walk around, and conveys a great atmosphere of study and knowledge. There are delightful little nooks with benches, where students read or chat. Some places are reserved only for students and staff, which is logical so as not to hinder daily life. I recommend leaving the old campus and visiting the faculty of science, across the street, a modern building, where you can see the classrooms, of strange simplicity, devoid of sumptuousness, that one might expect to find in one of the most expensive universities. In some of them it is even possible to see the activity of students and teachers. In the central hall there is also a very interesting exhibition of the evolution of ordering, from its origin to the present day. Finally, we were impressed by the majesty of the Memorial Church. It is also a good idea to walk through some of the surrounding streets of the neighborhood. The whole activity lasts about 3/4 hours."

We wanted to see this famous university campus that we had heard about forever. So after breakfast, one cold morning, we left our hotel in Cambridge and took the street. We preferred to walk rather than go by other means and we didn't regret it. We took Cambridge St from Lechmere station and (it was well worth it) enjoyed the very picturesque cityscape.
The campus is a very beautiful place full of buildings of different design and size, in the middle of big trees and with many paths where students and professors keep passing by. You can feel the student atmosphere and, at the same time, there is an air of a Sunday afternoon because of the quietness of the place. In addition, I understand there are several museums (natural history, art, etc.) that we did not visit.

Boston in May was warm and a little hot, so it was very comfortable and the scenery was so beautiful that I really hated to leave. LOL!
Harvard University was also very impressive with its lush greenery, blue sky, green, and beige school buildings.
The statue of Harvard University is open to the public, and there is a jinx that if you stroke the legs of the statue, you will be admitted to Harvard University. The statue is filled with young people who seem to be Harvard applicants.
However, there were also many Chinese and Korean people behaving in a vulgar and offensive manner.
However, Boston in May is still very beautiful, so why don't you go and touch the legs of the Harvard statue? (^ ^)
By the way, I recommend taking the subway because Boston's subway system is very accessible to major tourist attractions.
It is rather expensive (2.75üí≤ for a single ticket), but it is a good way to get to the main attractions. However, if you purchase a day pass, you can ride as much as you want for about 20üí≤.
The great thing about the Boston subway is that it is not a one-day pass like in Japan (only for the day you buy it), but a true one-day pass that is valid for 24 hours from the time you buy it! LOL!
I highly recommend purchasing a one-day subway ticket for Boston!"

From the outset, in addition to all its prestige, the university stands out for its grandiose red brick structures (which, by the way, are very typical of the entire Massachusetts region), and which are likely to look very familiar to you because they have been the setting for several films such as Indomitable Boy, A Father's Love and the obvious The Social Network, which tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg and the creation of Facebook right there, inside those brick walls!

(and it even feels like you're visiting someone you know, because you've seen the place so much in movies, series, documentaries....kkk)
What's more, it's a beautiful place to be, nice to sit and read in the gardens (of course, I went in September and the days are sunny and still warm), with an incredible diversity of people and languages.
Not to mention all the culture you can enjoy, such as the museum, the library...
Even the tour (which seems a bit too touristy) is worth doing.

I know more about the top 100 universities in the U.S. than most counselors, including what kind of students they have, what majors they have, and what their graduation rates are.
I can assure you that Harvard is a great university. I think it is the best in the world.
They have a lot of money for research, and they have the most money in the world, so their tuition is cheap.
Compared to other universities, it is not geeky, not extremely liberal or conservative.
It's not a bunch of spoiled kids screaming like idiots every night, and it's not all studying to death.
It is not mammoth like a state university, although some have pointed out that class sizes are too large and professors don't teach,
The students are all smart, so they don't drop classes.
Even if an assistant teaches, the quality of the assistant is better than a poor professor.
The university is very famous for medicine and law, but it is also strong in Japanese studies.
The writer Haruki Murakami was there for a while."

Ellos fueron entrenados para eso y van contando datos realmente interesantes e historias de la universidad que uno no conocer√≠a si recorre por su cuenta. Ademas tienen muy buena onda e informan como se hace para ingresar a la Universidad y las becas que existen.
Lo primero que hay que hacer al llegar en tren a Harvard, es arreglar la visita hay que ir a Information Center de Harvard (son cupos limitados por hora) , que no esta adentro de la Universidad sino afuera, en la esquina de una de las entradas (es todo muy chico as√≠ que es f√°cil encontrar o preguntar).
La visita dura 1 hora aproximadamente.

You can enter and walk freely around the university grounds and enter some of the buildings, but to make the visit worthwhile, it is best to take a tour guided by students who are free.
They were trained for that and they tell really interesting facts and stories about the university that you wouldn't know if you went on your own. They are also very cool and inform you on how to get into the university and the scholarships that are available.
The first thing to do when you arrive by train to Harvard, is to arrange the visit to the Information Center of Harvard (there are limited spaces per hour), which is not inside the University but outside, in the corner of one of the entrances (it is very small so it is easy to find or ask).
The visit lasts about 1 hour. If you have to wait, you can walk around the town a little bit and there are some stores with very funny and cheap souvenirs (good option to buy small gifts for friends or family)."

Nel nostro caso, essendo in quattro, la scelta pi√π ragionevole √® stata il taxi, che ci ha fruttato anche una bella chiacchierata con un giovane tassista etiope.
Abbiamo affrontato la visita approfittando dei tour informativi generali guidati dagli studenti (in inglese, dove la principale difficolt√† di comprensione sta nel fatto che le descrizioni sono snocciolate all'aperto e subiscono quindi tutti i disturbi ambientali dovuti al traffico, agli onnipresenti lavori in corso, ecc., ma rimangono sufficientemente fruibili e ricchi di aneddoti e informazioni), il che ci ha permesso di apprezzare la notevole estensione del campus e l'atmosfera di relax che ne domina il parco.
Purtroppo le strutture non sono visitabili all'interno, tuttavia l'Harvard Yard ha un sapore architettonicamente molto tradizionale.
Giusti per fare qualche confronto, a fronte delle nostre domande abbiamo capito che si tratta di corsi che hanno un costo paragonabile alle pi√π prestigiose universit√† italiane e anche il percorso accademico e l'impostazione dei corsi √® abbastanza in linea con la nostra. La differenza pi√π evidente rimane proprio la vita nel campus, che √® la formula largamente preferita di frequenza e per molti ragazzi rappresenta anche il distacco dalla famiglia (no bamboccioni ...).
Se siete interessati al merchandising, al di l√† del piccolo store attiguo all'information center, segnalo la presenza di un bellissimo negozio (Harvard Coop) con uno sterminato assortimento e prezzi in linea, quindi non popolari.",5,11,7,2015,UTC,it,1593,"Harvard is easily accessible from downtown Boston by various public transportation. In our case, there being four of us, the most reasonable choice was the cab, which also earned us a nice chat with a young Ethiopian taxi driver.
We approached the visit by taking advantage of the general student-led informational tours (in English, where the main difficulty in understanding lies in the fact that the descriptions are pitted outdoors and thus suffer all the environmental disturbances due to traffic, ubiquitous construction work, etc., but remain sufficiently usable and rich in anecdotes and information), which allowed us to appreciate the considerable extent of the campus and the relaxed atmosphere that dominates its grounds.
Unfortunately, the facilities cannot be visited inside, yet the Harvard Yard has an architecturally very traditional flavor.
Just to make some comparisons, in the face of our questions we realized that these are courses that are comparable in cost to the most prestigious Italian universities, and the academic path and course setting is also quite in line with ours. The most obvious difference remains just the campus life, which is the widely preferred formula of attendance and for many young people also represents detachment from the family (no bamboozling ...).
If you are interested in merchandising, beyond the small store adjacent to the information center, I point out the presence of a beautiful store (Harvard Coop) with an endless assortment and prices in line, so not popular."

You can purchase a guide map in Japanese at the Harvard University Tourist Information Center. I don't remember the price, but I think it was $1-$2. The map is just a sheet of paper, but the explanations are quite easy to understand, and we had a lot of fun just going around by ourselves following the indicated route. I recommend it.

Une des nombreuses entr√©e du campus universitaire, celles sur Massachusetts Avenue, est la plus proche d'acc√®s en arrivant par m√©tro.

En entrant par ce portail, √† votre droite, vous aurez le Massachussetts Hall, √©rig√© en 1720, c'est le plus vieux b√¢timent du site. Le bureau du recteur et les √©tudiants de 1e ann√©e s'y trouvent.

√Ä votre gauche vous avez Harvard Hall qui fut d√©truit par un violent incendie qui brula le tiers du campus en 1764.

Si vous contourner Harvard Hall, derri√®re, vous y trouverez une petite chapelle, la Holden Chapel -- construite en 1744, elle servi de chapelle, caserne de pompier, labo de chimie, et maintenant c'est un lieu de chorale.

Revenez sur vos pas, l'immense b√¢timent blanc en plein centre tu terrain, c'est le University Hall qui abrite les bureaux administratifs depuis 1815. Devant vous y trouverez une statue de John Harvard ... apparemment, toucher son pied gauche apporte la chance et le savoir.

Contourner vers la droite et derri√®re vous arriverez √† la Harry Wilkins Widener Library, biblioth√®que qui contient 3,5 millions de livres. Nomm√© en l'honneur de Harry Elkins Widener, un √©tudiant qui a gradu√© de Harvard en 1907. Elle a √©t√© construite par sa m√®re apr√®s la mort de celui-ci dans le naufrage du Titanic en 1912.

Cela fait le tour des b√¢timents important √† l'int√©rieur de l'enceinte m√™me ... tout le reste est b√¢ti autour : 

- Fogg Art Museum o√π on peut admirer plusieurs toiles de Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, Renoir & Degas 

- Memorial Hall (1870) -- centre communautaire pour √©tudiants de 1e ann√©e, Avec son allure de cath√©drale gothique, elle se veut un hommage en m√©moire des dipl√¥m√©s tu√©s au combat de la guerre de s√©cession.

It comprises over 400 buildings, some of which house museums open to the public.

One of the many entrances to the university campus, on Massachusetts Avenue, is the closest to the subway station.

Entering through this portal, on your right is Massachusetts Hall, erected in 1720 and the oldest building on the site. It houses the Rector's Office and the 1st year student lounge.

To your left is Harvard Hall, which was destroyed by a violent fire in 1764, burning one-third of the campus.

If you go around Harvard Hall, behind it, you'll find a small chapel, Holden Chapel - built in 1744, it served as a chapel, fire station, chemistry lab, and now as a choir house.

Retrace your steps to the huge white building in the center of the grounds, University Hall, which has housed the administrative offices since 1815. In front of it you'll find a statue of John Harvard ... apparently, touching his left foot brings luck and knowledge.

Go around to the right and behind you you'll come to the Harry Wilkins Widener Library, which contains 3.5 million books. Named in honor of Harry Elkins Widener, a student who graduated from Harvard in 1907. It was built by his mother after his death in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.

The area between the 2 buildings is the Tercentenary Theater - where all the white chairs are lined up for students and parents at the annual graduation ceremony.

It circles all the important buildings within the grounds ... everything else is built around it:

- Fogg Art Museum, with paintings by Rembrandt, Monet, Picasso, Renoir & Degas

- Memorial Hall (1870) -- community center for 1st-year students. With its Gothic cathedral-like appearance, it stands as a memorial to graduates killed in action during the Civil War.

- Cambridge fire station serving Harvard.

- Harvard Museum of Natural History

You take the red subway line to Alewife, the station is Harvard and during the ride the subway goes outside and gives a beautiful view of the city.
As soon as you get out of the subway to the square, there is a tourist office where you can get a map and take a tour. The doors are open and even though you are not a student or teacher, they treat you very well as a visitor, it is a nice experience to do in a few hours and get a nice view, there is a lot of green to stop and rest, and it is so close to Boston that it is worth taking a morning or half a morning, that way.

Although the place name is Cambridge, Cambridge University is a British university. The grounds are basically open because it is a university, but I did not go inside the building because I did not think it was a good place for tourists to walk around. We did not go into the ""Harvard Museum of Natural History"" because I did not think it was a good place for tourists to walk around in the building. (I am not interested in that kind of things.) However, it might be a good idea to enter the museum as a historic building.
It was a Saturday in early September, and I saw a couple of young men carrying a large sofa by two people before going to Harvard. Why? I wondered why, but I found out the reason when I entered the campus. It seemed they were having a flea market for unused items, and they were selling sofas and even crooked wire hangers. There was also a party(?) on the lawn in front of the museum. It was very interesting to see a part of students' life.
I saw the movie ""Social Network"" on the plane on the way back to Japan, and I was convinced that Harvard University is a good place to study. It was a tragedy or a trouble for a genius programmer who got mixed up in a famous university where children of good families enter, and the actual atmosphere of Harvard made me realize the strict elitist consciousness that is difficult to see in the synopsis of the movie. I think it is a well-made film.
I couldn't find any souvenirs on campus, so I went to The Harvard Coop (a bookstore) near Harvard Square station and bought a T-shirt with the word Harvard on it. The bag was written as if it was also an MIT Coop, but I did not find any MIT-related goods. Since it is basically a bookstore, it might be more efficient to look for affiliated goods sold at another tourist attraction. Of course, there are lots of books. (Though they are basically in English)."

Harvard dan MIT persisnya berlokasi di kota yang sama, yakni Cambridge (walaupun banyak yang mengira berlokasi di Boston, karena Cambridge merupakan kota kecil berseberangan sungai dengan Boston).  Sebagai universitas tua, tentu banyak bangunan tua yang menarik untuk dilihat di kampus universitas ini.  Jarak antara Harvard dan MIT sangat dekat, berada dalam satu jalur subway (red line), hanya terpisah oleh satu stasiun saja.  Harvard dan MIT merupakan seteru abadi, namun persaingan yang sehat menyebabkan kedua universitas ini sama-sama maju pesat.

Jika anda berharap menemukan gedung-gedung ultra mewah di kampus ini, maka anda akan kecewa, karena gedung-gedung di kampus Harvard merupakan tipikal universitas tua di Amerika Serikat.  Kehebatan Harvard bukan pada fisik gedungnya, tetapi dari apa yang dihasilkan dari kegiatan akademiknya.  Harvard telah melahirkan 47 pemenang Nobel, 48 pemenang Pulitzer, dan 32 kepala negara.

Komposisi mahasiswanya juga sangat berbeda dengan perguruan tinggi di negara berkembang, termasuk Indonesia.  Di Harvard, jumlah mahasiswa S1 (undergraduate) sedikit, sekitar 6.700 orang saja, tetapi mahasiswa S2 dan S3 (graduate) mencapai 14.500 orang.  Ini merupakan salah satu ciri universitas riset.

As an old university, there are many interesting old buildings to see on the campus.  The distance between Harvard and MIT is very close, being on the same subway line (red line), separated by only one station.  Harvard and MIT are eternal enemies, but the healthy rivalry has led to both universities progressing rapidly.

If you're expecting to find ultra-luxurious buildings on this campus, then you'll be disappointed, as the buildings on Harvard's campus are typical of older universities in the United States.  Harvard's greatness is not in its physical buildings, but in what it produces from its academic activities.  Harvard has produced 47 Nobel laureates, 48 Pulitzer winners, and 32 heads of state.

letta per la prima volta la dichiarazione dell'indipendenza, piazzetta , casa, e balconcino esistono
tutt'ora.
In questa meravigliosa citt√† che in alcuni luoghi assomiglia a Londra siamo andati a visitare
la famosa  universit√† di John Harvard , fondata dall'omonimo prete nel 1630 .
Gi√† l'entrata principale √® piuttosto pomposa , e con tanto di stemma, poi proseguendo
all'interno si notano edifici d'epoca fatti con mattoni d'argilla rossa, molto belli a dire il vero,
e poi quelli pi√π nuovi non altrettanto belli , quello che mi ha colpito era lo spazio verde che
c'era, molti prati verdi, zone ricreative, e moltissimi giovani di tutte le parti del mondo che se la godevano giocando tra di loro, veramente un bel vedere.
Il refettorio √® ricavato da una bella vecchia grande chiesa, in mattoni rossi naturalmente, siamo entrati e c'era abbastanza baccano, centinaia di studenti erano intenti chi a mangiare, chi a chiacchierare chi a  cantare, ci venne subito incontro l'addetto alla sicurezza il quale con molto
garbo disse a me e mia moglie che non potevamo rimanere dentro la chiesa/refettorio.
Continuammo il nostro giro ed entrando da una porta aperta salimmo le scale belle pulite 
bianche silenziosissime, e ci trovammo al secondo piano nientepopodimeno che in direzione ,
anche li trovammo 2 segretarie le quali molto gentilmente ci dissero che non potevamo stare .
Ce da dire che noi impersonavamo perfettamente i turisti sulla cinquantina con tanto di macchina fotografica ciondoloni venuti da molto lontano, per ammirare quel pop√≤ di universit√†.
Ci dirigemmo verso il self service , molto grande , e con diversi punti di vendita come pizzeria,
cafeteria, ecc. ecc.  il nome della pizzeria era errato,  "" Bella  Boca "" noi lo facemmo presente
e ci dissero che l'avrebbero corretto, in un'altra struttura visitammo le aule , le quali  segnalazioni 
erano alfanumeriche, non molto grandi a dire il vero, max 150 persone, li nessuno ci disse nulla,
entrammo tranquillamente nelle aule e guardammo .
Dopo aver molto gentilmente ed educatamente rotto un po' le scatole a tutti attraversammo il
parco verso il monumento al prete  John Harvard il quale ha il piede sinistro completamente
levigato per il fatto che tutti appoggiano le mani su quel piede per farsi la foto, me compreso.
Ha un certo fascino la galleria  dei ""famosi "" , le quali targhe all'interno portano incisi nomi
e cognomi di personaggi che hanno fatto la storia degli Stati Uniti, caratteristiche le fontanelle di legno dove abbeverarsi.

first read the Declaration of Independence, little square, house, and balcony still exist
to this day.
In this wonderful city that in some places resembles London we went to visit
the famous John Harvard University , founded by the priest of the same name in 1630 .
Already the main entrance is rather pompous , and complete with coat of arms, then continuing
inside you notice period buildings made of red clay bricks, very beautiful actually ,
and then the newer ones not as beautiful , what struck me was the green space that
there was, lots of green lawns, recreational areas, and lots of young people from all parts of the world enjoying it playing with each other, really a beautiful sight.
The refectory is made out of a beautiful big old church, red brick of course, we entered and there was quite a hubbub, hundreds of students were intent on some eating, some chatting some singing, we were immediately met by the security officer who very
politely told my wife and I that we could not stay inside the church/refectory.
We continued our tour and entering through an open door went up the beautifully clean stairs
white very quiet, and we found ourselves on the second floor no less than in the direction ,
even there we found 2 secretaries who very kindly told us that we could not stay .
It must be said that we were perfectly impersonating the tourists in their fifties, complete with dangling cameras who had come from far and wide to admire that populace of a university.
We headed for the self-service , very large , and with several outlets such as pizzeria,
cafeteria, etc. etc. the name of the pizzeria was wrong, "" Bella Boca "" we pointed it out
and they told us they would correct it, in another facility we visited the classrooms , which reports
were alphanumeric, not very big actually, max 150 people, there nobody said anything to us,
we quietly entered the classrooms and looked .
After very kindly and politely breaking everyone's balls a little bit we crossed the
park toward the monument to Priest John Harvard who has his left foot completely
polished due to the fact that everyone rests their hands on that foot to take their picture, including me.
It has a certain fascination with the gallery of the ""famous "" , whose plaques inside bear engraved names
and surnames of people who have made U.S. history, features wooden drinking fountains where you can drink.

Hay varias formas de llegar hasta esta facultad. Hay que tener en cuenta que el sistema de transporte en esta ciudad es muy bueno y seguro.
Nosotros tomamos un Tour en espa√±ol de la empresa Don Quijote sacamos los datos de una revista del Hotel. 
Paso la pagina por si les interesa http://www.tourboston.com/
Este Tour nos llevo entre varios sitios a la Universidad.
El Guia nos acompa√±o para ver desde afuera una clase , fue interesante la experiencia, ver a los estudiantes en clase,  Caminamos por el barrio que la rodea, que es donde viven los estudiantes vimos sus casas y los comercios de la zona, tanto las casas como la onda de los bares no es como uno se lo imaginaria , es mas bien precario, casual no muy elegante y se puede ver las casitas un tanto desordenadas des prolijas,
Ademas de bares tambi√©n hay las t√≠picas tiendas de recuerdo.
Los estudiantes te pasan por al lado como si no vieran al turismo deben estar acostumbrados a que la gente los visite como peces. Uno los puede ver apresurados y en su mundo.
A diferencia de la UCLA aqui los estudiantes se ven mas arreglados, serios y menos distra√≠dos
Tambi√©n se puede observar la casa donde vivieron presidentes en su √©poca de estudiantes y hasta un Bill Gates. Fue muy √∫til la explicaci√≥n en espa√±ol del gu√≠a del Tour.

We took a tour in Spanish from the company Don Quijote, we got the information from a magazine of the Hotel.
I am passing the page in case you are interested http://www.tourboston.com/
This tour took us to the University.
The guide accompanied us to see a class from the outside, it was an interesting experience, to see the students in class, we walked around the surrounding neighborhood, which is where the students live, we saw their houses and stores in the area, both the houses and the vibe of the bars is not as one would imagine, it is rather precarious, casual, not very elegant and you can see the little houses a bit messy and untidy,
Besides the bars there are also the typical souvenir stores.
The students pass you by as if they don't see the tourists, they must be used to people visiting them like fish. One can see them in a hurry and in their own world.
Unlike at UCLA here the students look more groomed, serious and less distracted.
You can also see the house where presidents lived when they were students and even a Bill Gates. The tour guide's explanation in Spanish was very helpful.
We also learned that they have their own police and their own bank. Very interesting. It is worth going."

Altrettanto sbaglia chi restasse deluso perch√® non pu√≤ visitare nessun edificio: assicuro che le aule di Harvard, le sue biblioteche, i laboratori, i dormitori sono esattamente come quelli di quasi tutte le circa 3.300 universit√† degli Stati Uniti, anzi, alcune ne hanno di migliori. Di diverso, Harvard ha la storia e il valore: a testimonianza dell'importanza attribuita all'educazione, Harvard √® stata fondata dai Padri Pellegrini nel 1636, solo 15 anni dopo il loro sbarco sulle coste del Massachusetts. Il suo nome ricorda un oscuro pastore protestante morto a poco pi√π di 30 anni, che lasci√≤ a una scuola gi√† esistente il patrimonio dei suoi 2.000 libri. Grazie all'impegno e alla dedizione profusi negli ultimi 300 anni dal personale docente e non docente, Harvard √® diventata la prima Universit√† al mondo o comunque una delle prime due al mondo. Il modello didattico prevede l'elevatissima qualit√† dell'insegnamento (molti professori sono premi Nobel), l'applicazione di criteri di valutazione meritocratici, rigore, ordine e severit√†. I risultati? Da Harvard sono usciti i Presidenti americani Theodore Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Barack Obama, il VIce Presidente Al Gore, un numero impressionante di presidenti canadesi e latino americani, il Premier israeliano Netanyahu e poi BIll Gates, l'Aga Khan e pure un tal Kaszinsky, meglio noto come ""Unabomber"" (forse una difettosit√† nei criteri di selezione all'ingresso?). Non tutti i laureati ad Harvard si sono buttati in politica o negli affari: Jack Lemmon, Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Natalie Portman a altri hanno fatto del cinema, Mark Zuckerberg ha inventato Facebook e Jeremy Lin √® una stella dei New York Knickerborkers di basket. Sorvolo sulla ventina di istituti di ricerca, sui PhD, sui Master: quelli potete guardarveli nel sito dell'Universit√†. Se si sa cosa √® Harvard, aggirarsi tra gli edifici del campus o guardare la statua di John Harvard regala la stessa emozione che si pu√≤ provare entrando in un santuario. Questo ovviamente √® un santuario laico, tutto dedicato alla cultura.",0,27,8,2012,UTC,it,2183,"Those who expect who knows what thrills from a visit to Harvard are wrong: it is neither an equestrian circus nor a fashion street. Equally wrong are those who would be disappointed because they cannot visit any of the buildings: I assure you that Harvard's lecture halls, its libraries, laboratories, and dormitories are exactly like those of almost all of the approximately 3,300 universities in the United States, indeed, some have better ones. What is different, Harvard has history and value: reflecting the importance placed on education, Harvard was founded by the Pilgrim Fathers in 1636, only 15 years after they landed on the shores of Massachusetts. Its name recalls an obscure Protestant pastor who died at the age of just over 30, leaving an existing school the legacy of his 2,000 books. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of faculty and non-teaching staff over the past 300 years, Harvard has become the world's premier university, or at least one of the top two in the world. The educational model includes the very high quality of teaching (many professors are Nobel laureates), the application of meritocratic evaluation criteria, rigor, order and severity. The results? Out of Harvard have come American Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Barack Obama, VIce President Al Gore, an impressive number of Canadian and Latin American presidents, Israeli PM Netanyahu and then BIll Gates, the Aga Khan and even one such Kaszinsky, better known as the ""Unabomber"" (perhaps a flaw in the selection criteria at entry?). Not all Harvard graduates have jumped into politics or business: Jack Lemmon, Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Natalie Portman a others have made movies, Mark Zuckerberg invented Facebook and Jeremy Lin is a star of the New York Knickerborkers basketball team. I'll gloss over the 20 or so research institutes, PhDs, Master's degrees: you can look those up on the University's website. If you know what Harvard is, wandering around the campus buildings or looking at the statue of John Harvard gives you the same thrill as entering a shrine.

In addition, the area around Harvard Square feels very young and student-like, with hip stores such as Urban Outfitters and boutiques as well as young restaurants, and there is also the Harvard Coop, the unofficial bookstore of Harvard University, which has an impressive selection of both specialist books and fiction (as well as Harvard merchandise, if you really want to buy a Harvard T-shirt).
