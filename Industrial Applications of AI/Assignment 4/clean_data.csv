Reverend John Harvard, who bequeathed his entire library and half of his estate, is the University's namesake. Just 16 years following the landing of the Pilgrims, the original focus of Harvard University was to educate Christian clergy with its motto ""Truth for Christ and the Church"". Presidents, billionaires and Rhodes Scholars are only some of the illustrious graduates. The historic tree covered grounds with brick architecture are worthy of tour. The Gothic-Revival Memorial Hall/Lowell Complex was constructed in the 1870's to honor those men who served in the Civil War. Do enter this majestic building and view the colorful and stunning stained-glass windows, by both prominent artisans: Tiffany and LaFarge. Outside of University Hall in the Old Yard, take note of the bronze seated statue of John Harvard, and rub his golden left foot for good luck. Stroll past the 1916 Widener Library, the largest of Harvard's dozens of libraries, and don't miss the Memorial Church with its lovely light interior. We took the MBTA Red Line which delivered us to the Harvard Square Station. Easy, quick, convenient and inexpensive, this is a great means of travel. Up at street level when you depart the station, is a visitor kiosk for guidance. We walked the campus on a rainy day which I would not recommend, but it is doable. We had no other option.

The ubiquitous red-brown brick buildings added to the serious and sombre ambiance ‚Äì Harvard crimson is the official colour. One abiding memory is a throng of Japanese tourists walking around with selfie sticks snapping photos of themselves. Nevertheless, this is America's oldest university, and one of the most prestigious institutions in the world, with a long line of notable alumni, as noted by other reviewers. This is evidenced by the number of writers, thinkers, and Nobel laurates to have studied here, reflected in the subtle academic vibe exhibited by the students and staff, passing through the central courtyard where commencement is held. 

This area is surrounded by a number of famous and historic buildings - the Widener Library, Harvard Memorial Church and both the white granite University Hall and Sever Hall. The landmark John Harvard statue, sitting on a 6 foot granite plinth, is located outside University Hall facing both Harvard and Massachusetts Halls, and the Johnston Gate. Audio files of historical information on each of the buildings in Harvard Yard can be downloaded. It is good that visitors are welcome to roam freely around the campus of this famous university and see how it feels to be on this campus.

The Harvard Museum of Natural History is housed in the University Museum Building, and the affiliated Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology is located at Divinity Avenue on the campus. This is a very active university, so, of necessity, there is limited access during academic sessions. We didn‚Äôt go on any of the guided tours but did avail of the tour pamphlets at the tour office.

It's Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the oldest and richest and most prestigious university in the United States. Established in 1636 and located about 3 miles northwest of Boston, it is a private Ivy League research university whose history, influence and wealth have made it one of the world's most prestigious universities. Its $34.5 billion financial endowment is the largest of any academic institution. Its library, the world's largest academic and private library system, comprises 79 individual libraries with over 18 million volumes. Its alumni include eight U.S. Presidents, 62 living billionaires, 359 Rhodes Scholars and 130 Nobel Laureates. Impressed? My wife and I were visiting Boston for the first time and a trip to Harvard was a no-brainer. I wanted to see Harvard Stadium, home of the Harvard-Yale football game that dates to 1875. And I wanted to see Harvard Yard, the oldest part of the Harvard campus, its historic center and its crossroads. Bounded by Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge Street, Broadway and Quincy Street, the grassy area of 22.4 acres enclosed by fence with 27 gates contains most of the freshman dormitories, the school's most important libraries, Memorial Church, several classroom and departmental buildings and the offices of the Dean of Harvard College and President of Harvard College. So how do you see it all. You can't. For example, there are 20 museums of culture, science and digital collections on campus, including Harvard Art Museum, Arnold Arboretum, Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard Museum of Natural History and Harvard Museums of Science and Culture.

2017-07-29 07:47:32+00:00,Desktop,3,2,Know the address and price of the tour you want to do - the other tours will try to trick you,"If you have your heart set on a certain tour, be sure to know the exact address and price (if any) for what you want to do. Other tours that are out and making money will trick you into their own tour. 
We wanted to do the Historical Tour and then the Student Walking Tour that is detailed on the Harvard website. We searched for a long time for Smith Campus Center, Harvard Information Center, not realizing it was under construction. Per the website there is no charge for this tour. 
A waitress at our restaurant directed us to a tiny round building in a loop. A guy outside in a Harvard shirt with ""Tours"" sign directed us inside when I asked him about the Smith Center. Inside, two guys rang up $24.00 and acted like they didn't understand me and insisted that this was the historical tour. The guy outside said that this was the tour. We went on this stupid thing but I noticed that we only stayed in the public commons areas and then he lead us to a tiny shirt shop.

Take a walk through the yard, where all Harvard Freshman spend a year before being sorted into a house for the remaining three years, unless they join a social club or elect to live off campus. While in the yard, peek into memorial chapel - one of the few buildings open to the public.

Next, visit the Harvard Art Museum. The collections in this new museum are world class.

You also should check out the glass flowers at the Museum of Natural History - they are legendary. 

Make sure to take a quick walk through the Radcliffe Yard, which is across the Cambridge Common. It contains some of Harvard's oldest buildings.

The ART American Repatory Theater may have a show playing. Check ahead and build you visit around one. Many have gone to Broadway after being shaken down in this famed theater. 

Down the street form the ART is the famed home of poet Longfellow. If you like to walk. Continue down Brattle street away from the square. The homes are the finest in Cambridge. Also, the Mt. Auburn cemetery is also a favorite. 

Hungry, well your in luck. Italian, think Toscano or Benadetto. Burgers, go strait to BARTLEY'S. If not open, Tastey Burger or Shake Shack will hit the spot. Brunch, Henriettas table #1 and tres cher. If looking for affordable brunch, hit Park on lower JFK Street, excellent food a la cart. American Bistro, Harvest. French, Les Sablons. Both are fantastic. Want Hip with music most evenings, Beat Hotel. Finally, if you want over the top Mexican and it's cheap! Felipes is tour place. Drinks upstairs on the deck can be lots of fun during the warmer months, but arrive early or be prepared to wait for a while. Don't be scared off by the lines - they move quickly.

If your early and want breakfast, Darwins or Flour and on Mt. Auburn and Crema on the corner of Brattle are all popular with us locals. Do get a cup of hot chocolate in the winter - L.A.Burdicks - don't miss this opportunity on a cold day. Think thick delcious melting chocolate you can drink.

The tour was let by Branson and it was a very enjoyable experience. He was clear in his explanations and provided a lot of funny insights. We walked through the different university buildings (outside only) and learnt a lot about the campus history. Highly recommended. We had a great time!!

2016-07-04 16:38:08+00:00,Mobile,4,1,DIY walking tour in Cambridge ,"I stayed at Boston Park Plaza near Public Garden, and form there I walked over to Harvard University. The thing I enjoy most when visiting a new place is just walking around to really see and experience the area. From my hotel to Harvard, it was a   an-hour-and-12-minute walk, according to Google Maps. If you are an urban hiker and are OK walking this kind of distance like me, read on!

From Public Garden, there are many streets running parallel to one another. I walked on all of them and the Esplanade toward Harvard Bridge. They are all charming. Newbury offers high-end shopping and the view of the Charles River walking along the Esplanade is wonderful. 

After crossing Harvard Bridge, you see MIT. I visited on the 4th of July, so unfortunately everything was closed. Otherwise, I would have been interested in visiting MIT Museum. After seeing MIT, stay on Massachusetts Avenue no matter what Google Maps says. I typed in Harvard University as my destination, and really got lost. So try some other destination or just stay on Massachusetts till you see Harvard. 

The area surrounding the University is very charming, with lots of eateries and shops. The red brick campus is, of course, worth a visit. Now, here's one of the highlights of my walking tour:

Whenever I plan a walking tour like this,  especially on Sunday or major holidays, I really worry about whether or not there are any toilets along the way. ( Harvard and MIT are universities, not amusement parks, people! ). I did some search and found a very recent article saying ""the very first public bathroom in the Harvard area made a ""grand opening"" in February, 2016!  The article sounded like the appropriateness of putting a public loo right in front of Harvard was controversial for many reasons. I was so curious I went to find it, and to see if it's really there.

The bathroom was very clean and  spacious, and very good-looking. Only one stall. For those who go to a bathroom twice a day, it might be laughable for me to write this much about one. But for others, it is an important issue. If I hadn't stumbled on the article about this new addition to the area, I probably would have visited Aquarium on the 4th. 

So, to whomever came up to this idea and made it happen, thank you very much. I really enjoyed visiting Cambridge on Independence Day, 2016.
",0,4,7,2016,UTC,en,2341,"I stayed at Boston Park Plaza near Public Garden, and form there I walked over to Harvard University. The thing I enjoy most when visiting a new place is just walking around to really see and experience the area.

2016-02-01 14:42:50+00:00,Desktop,5,2,Getting Smart at Harvard,"Being in Boston invites for sure for paying a visit to Harvard. Being in a place having hosted more than 40 Nobel price winners is for sure exciting. You can approach such a visit in many different ways.

The hanging out version:

Breath the culture, mingle with the students, start conversations, ask what people like, sit just down and enjoy the atmosphere, stroll around not missing out the library building offering you the exposer to a lot of very individual persons, who for instance just occupy the benches, hang out in the internet, stretch out and sleep or talk with you cause you seem to have time. Like that you'll spend a jolly day and remember for ever Harvard was a place feeling you good.

Making a museums tour version:

You can of course also book or make a tour for instance and you gonna meet the 
Harvard Museum of Natural History, Harvard University Herbaria, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, the Harvard Universitria and the Mineralogical and Geological Museum and if you've swallowed it all, you may remember Harvard is a place making you smart. Such tours can be booked in local tourist agencies and will cost you about 20 dollars (Jan 2016)

Exploring the surroundings version:

Of course even in times of Netflix and Spotify the students love to meet somewhere and getting entertained. Meaning after looking around and enjoying little caf√©s and bars offering healthy stuff (naturally raised chicken making the premium price of your Caesar Salad for instance) you will find a number of local clubs, to hang out and listen to some good music, playing chess or back gammon in public or dare to sit down and show off playing master mind - just because you may feel so much inspired.

Should you be around in winter times like me don't miss ice skates, because there is mostly an ice scating parcour built up.

As I had only about 2 hours to spend at Harvard University, I decided I could get a glimpse of some of the highlights of Harvard University by attending one of the Official Harvard Tour.

The Official Harvard Tour has its earliest tour of the day start at 10 a.m. As I was in Harvard area very early, I signed up for the tour way before 9.30 a.m. I subsequently learnt that it was helpful to be early to sign up for the Official Harvard Tour. The tours were so popular that the 10 a.m. tour was fully booked before 9.45 a.m. However, as registration starts only one hour before a designated tour, it does help to plan ahead the visit to the Harvard Events and Information Center in Holyoke Center so as to secure a place on the Official Harvard Tour.

The Official Harvard Tour was led by one of the student volunteers. In addition to attending the Official Harvard Tour, I bought myself a copy of ""A self-guided walking tour of Harvard Yard and surrounding areas"".

The Official Harvard Tour brought us to various locations on Harvard Yard such as the Massachusetts Hall, the Harvard Hall, the Science Center, the Memorial Hall, the Widener Library and the site of the John Harvard Statue.

I love the spaciousness of Harvard Yard, and it was a lovely experience being there on a day in summer.

During the tour, I learnt that the Memorial Hall is the building whereby first-year students of Harvard would dine in so as to foster a sense of community. The Massachusetts Hall is the oldest building that is still standing at Harvard. I felt privileged to be visiting Harvard University which has a long history.

It would be nice to offer a gratuity at the end of the tour.

Upon arrival, we were impressed with the campus, with satellite kind of clusters among academic schools, hostels, retail and F&B outlets, among many others. We were also attracted to the various red-brick buildings. They were very nice and magnificent and solely the property of the University. In deed, this place was just like a mini-town by itself and its full of energy, vibe and activities on going.

We walked around the campus and soon we came by the most visited place in the campus. The statue of the sitting ""Mr Harvard"". Many people came forward to be photographed and touching the ""leg"" and hopefully their children/grandchildren will be blessed to be as smart. Haha, a myth? Anyway, just to clarify that this person was not Mr Harvard (the founder of the institution) himself. As in those days, the university was unable to find a photo of Mr Harvard himself when erecting a monument in honour of him, it organized a contest to look for the ""most good looking"" person and selected the winner to have the monument made after him. So this ""Mr Harvard"" was handsome. This story was shared to us by our guide.

The campus was lovely and serene, with buildings surrounding greenery landscape and with chairs and benches around for students or visitors to sit and rest while enjoying the beauty of the campus. There was a train station in the campus, besides many nice architectural buildings like churches as well.

So we walked around the campus with a feeling of being a ""Harvard"" student and somehow feel ""proud"" to be one as the university is world ranked Number 1.

We came by the campus circle where eateries, cafes and retail shops were located and had our breakfast there. People here were orderly and well mannered and polite. Prices here were reasonable and cheaper than elsewhere. Thereafter, we walked around the gift and book stores nearby, grabbing up some books and souvenirs.

Finally, we landed at the Graduate School of Arts and Social Sciences where I caught up with my associate for a while. Visited briefly on the LTs as well and was briefed about the history of the university and the years of transformation. I was then led to the Co-op store, ran by the students on vacation and bought some gift items as well as a form of support.

It was a lovely walk-around trip in Harvard university in Cambridge in Boston. The feeling was so closed to heart, perhaps due to the fact that I am an academic too. Shortly later, when returning to my coach, the place got busier and more pedestrians crowd jostling among buildings, traffic lights and cafes. Well, its the start of another day in campus!

2015-05-26 13:24:37+00:00,Desktop,5,1,Wonderful Tour of Harvard,"Loved this walking tour of Harvard University led by Eli on May 17th.  He was informative, humorous and full of fun facts.  Eli is so talented, he can walk backwards faster than I can walk forwards!  We covered the main campus - Harvard Yard, Widner Library and several dorms.  He had stories about each of the buildings including why they were built, who lived there and other interesting facts.

2014-11-26 21:45:48+00:00,Desktop,5,1,Breathtaking campus and excellent free tour!,"Visited Harvard on a recent trip to Boston. It was a short ""T"" trip via the red line, headed towards Alewife. The station name is ""Harvard"" and it brings you right to the famous Harvard Square. We joined a Student-Led Tour that departed from the Harvard Information Center, in the Smith Campus Center.

It was a walking tour of adult tourists not students. Our student leader was Jimmy. He was very familiar with the campus history, facts and details of the buildings interjected with lots of personal antidotes. Very enjoyable, personable and interesting young man.

We enjoyed the wonderful warm fall day and toured the following: Harvard Yard, Freshman dorms, Tercentenacy Theater, Widener Library, Memorial Hall, a Science centre, the John Harvard Statue and more. We did not enter any of the buildings except for the Memorial Hall. The building are amazing...red brick, some 300 years old. There are mature trees and wonderful roof lines to admire as well as steeples and grassy slopes. The architecture was striking...with a mix of traditional striped roofs and modern glass buildings from the 1070s.

After completing the tour we ambled around the campus to look at the Harvard Lampoon building. A quirky building with a smiling mouth and eyes. We recommend wandering the campus and enjoying all the free statues and the heritage buildings with their dormer windows. Breathtakingly Beautiful!

If you have time and the weather is fair, I recommend a short walk along the Charles River for a look at the buildings and bridges

Being tourists, we also stopped into the Coop store for some retail therapy. Lots of Harvard souvenirs to be purchased!

There are a few options for tours of Harvard but we elected the official tour provided by current students. This was apples to apples to the Yale tour we took. 

We were expecting much more from the Harvard tour. Unfortunately, it was rather boring as compared to the Yale tour. Perhaps it was the guide, but there were few fun, interesting historical stories. The tour was so dry, I think we would have had a better experience just roaming on our own. 

Harvard Yard is pretty with nice grassy areas and trees. It had colorful chairs in the center of the grass where students can hang out. There are a lot of historical buildings but the architecture isn't nearly as interesting as that of Yale. It was all just a little disappointing but we are glad we did it. Honestly, the campus is nothing special compared to many other campuses we have attended or explored. 

If we were students comparing the schools and taking the tours, we'd pick Yale hands down. 

Another note, there are no parking lots in the area. You have to use metered parking which is a max of 2 hours and accepts only quarters.

2013-03-04 12:36:34+00:00,Mobile,4,1,"Awesome experience, but I  wish I could enter more buildings","I have to admit the aura the surrounds Harvard lives up to it's reputation. It's easy to get  via the T, just jump on the outbound Red line.  We went a bit too late to get a tour so we walked round the Campus.We started off at the Harvard Business school which is on the Other side of the Charles River (approx 5min from the main campus) and then walked to the Main Campus. For the most part the buildings are of old architecture and definitely give that prestigious vibe. There is a photo opportunity around each corner.

Recently, I revisited Harvard University, and it completely changed my opinion. I am glad that we made the right decision to learn more about this renowned and historical school. We took the subway to Harvard Square Station and walked to Harvard Information Center in the Holyoke Center Arcade. This was a good start because they offer a free tour of the Harvard Yard, which is led by a senior student. Normally, it has 3 scheduled guided tours (10 am, 12 pm and 2 pm) everyday. It is suggested to check the schedule before you go because it might not have the tours due to various reasons. It is a one-hour walking tour, and it covers most of the campus and its history. You do not need to make a reservation, but sometimes you might need to wait for the next available tour. If you prefer self-guided walking tour, you can visit their mobile tour website.

Harvard University is an American private Ivy League research university which celebrated its 376th anniversary in 2012. It is the oldest institution of higher education in the United States. There are many historic buildings in Harvard Yard. The high Victorian Gothic style Memorial Hall is one of the iconic buildings on the campus. It was built in 1870s to honor the Harvard graduates who fought for the Union in the American Civil War. Today, the Sanders Theatre is a lecture and concert hall, and the Annenberg Hall is used as the dining hall for the freshmen. The interior of Memorial Hall is a must see, and you might need to wait in line because it is the most impressive place on the campus. Another interesting location you can‚Äôt miss is the John Harvard statue and its ‚ÄúStatue of the Three Lies‚Äù.

Unfortunately, I come from the UK, which has both Cambridge and Oxford universities with buildings dating back to the 1400s and older and the whole place just reeks of history, if that's what you're looking for. 
I understand I could have taken a tour, but the tour that was pushed quite heavily around Harvard was (unsurprisingly) the ""alternative and unofficial"" student tour, where you pay a student to tell you about their wacky student lifestyle. I didn't fancy that much either. 

I really can't think of much to recommend about Harvard University. As the title says, if you come from the UK and have been or lived in Cambridge or Oxford, or have visited them, Harvard feels very much like a poor relation. But if you've never been to either, you might find it a bit more interesting. ","Americans proud Harvard University. They buildings dating 1800s lots advances studies made.

We were visiting Boston over 5th to 8th July and took the metro to Harvard Uni thinking we would just have a quick wander around with the aid of our guidebook.

Best idea of the day! Our guide was a third year government law student who was full of enthusiasum, anecdotes, history and a blast to be with. The tour last about 1 1/2 hours and was pretty hard-paced, but you saw such a lot and learnt far more than you would from the guidebooks. Highly recommended. They suggest $10 per person and we were more than happy to hand over our $20 dollars at the end. The tour ends at the student gift shop which is run by the students and all profits are ploughed back into helping students. Prices were very reasonable - much cheaper than in Boston and I managed to get a uni hoodie for my daughter (who is off to uni in the UK soon) for about $15 dollars cheaper than I had saw in Boston. Around the gift shop there are plenty of places to eat and we had a late lunch at a great student pub, again very reasonable.

Hay peque√±os rincones deliciosos con bancos, donde los alumnos leen o conversan. Algunos sitios s√≥lo est√°n reservados para estudiantes y personal, lo cual es l√≥gico para no entorpecer la vida cotidiana.

Nel nostro caso, essendo in quattro, la scelta pi√π ragionevole √® stata il taxi, che ci ha fruttato anche una bella chiacchierata con un giovane tassista etiope.
Abbiamo affrontato la visita approfittando dei tour informativi generali guidati dagli studenti (in inglese, dove la principale difficolt√† di comprensione sta nel fatto che le descrizioni sono snocciolate all'aperto e subiscono quindi tutti i disturbi ambientali dovuti al traffico, agli onnipresenti lavori in corso, ecc., ma rimangono sufficientemente fruibili e ricchi di aneddoti e informazioni), il che ci ha permesso di apprezzare la notevole estensione del campus e l'atmosfera di relax che ne domina il parco.
Purtroppo le strutture non sono visitabili all'interno, tuttavia l'Harvard Yard ha un sapore architettonicamente molto tradizionale.
Giusti per fare qualche confronto, a fronte delle nostre domande abbiamo capito che si tratta di corsi che hanno un costo paragonabile alle pi√π prestigiose universit√† italiane e anche il percorso accademico e l'impostazione dei corsi √® abbastanza in linea con la nostra. La differenza pi√π evidente rimane proprio la vita nel campus, che √® la formula largamente preferita di frequenza e per molti ragazzi rappresenta anche il distacco dalla famiglia (no bamboccioni ...).

Unfortunately, the facilities cannot be visited inside, yet the Harvard Yard has an architecturally very traditional flavor.

letta per la prima volta la dichiarazione dell'indipendenza, piazzetta , casa, e balconcino esistono
tutt'ora.
In questa meravigliosa citt√† che in alcuni luoghi assomiglia a Londra siamo andati a visitare
la famosa  universit√† di John Harvard , fondata dall'omonimo prete nel 1630 .
Gi√† l'entrata principale √® piuttosto pomposa , e con tanto di stemma, poi proseguendo
all'interno si notano edifici d'epoca fatti con mattoni d'argilla rossa, molto belli a dire il vero,
e poi quelli pi√π nuovi non altrettanto belli , quello che mi ha colpito era lo spazio verde che
c'era, molti prati verdi, zone ricreative, e moltissimi giovani di tutte le parti del mondo che se la godevano giocando tra di loro, veramente un bel vedere.
Il refettorio √® ricavato da una bella vecchia grande chiesa, in mattoni rossi naturalmente, siamo entrati e c'era abbastanza baccano, centinaia di studenti erano intenti chi a mangiare, chi a chiacchierare chi a  cantare, ci venne subito incontro l'addetto alla sicurezza il quale con molto
garbo disse a me e mia moglie che non potevamo rimanere dentro la chiesa/refettorio.
Continuammo il nostro giro ed entrando da una porta aperta salimmo le scale belle pulite 
bianche silenziosissime, e ci trovammo al secondo piano nientepopodimeno che in direzione ,
anche li trovammo 2 segretarie le quali molto gentilmente ci dissero che non potevamo stare .
Ce da dire che noi impersonavamo perfettamente i turisti sulla cinquantina con tanto di macchina fotografica ciondoloni venuti da molto lontano, per ammirare quel pop√≤ di universit√†.
Ci dirigemmo verso il self service , molto grande , e con diversi punti di vendita come pizzeria,
cafeteria, ecc. ecc.  il nome della pizzeria era errato,  "" Bella  Boca "" noi lo facemmo presente
e ci dissero che l'avrebbero corretto, in un'altra struttura visitammo le aule , le quali  segnalazioni 
erano alfanumeriche, non molto grandi a dire il vero, max 150 persone, li nessuno ci disse nulla,
entrammo tranquillamente nelle aule e guardammo .
Dopo aver molto gentilmente ed educatamente rotto un po' le scatole a tutti attraversammo il
parco verso il monumento al prete  John Harvard il quale ha il piede sinistro completamente
levigato per il fatto che tutti appoggiano le mani su quel piede per farsi la foto, me compreso.
Ha un certo fascino la galleria  dei ""famosi "" , le quali targhe all'interno portano incisi nomi
e cognomi di personaggi che hanno fatto la storia degli Stati Uniti, caratteristiche le fontanelle di legno dove abbeverarsi.

Ademas de bares tambi√©n hay las t√≠picas tiendas de recuerdo.
Los estudiantes te pasan por al lado como si no vieran al turismo deben estar acostumbrados a que la gente los visite como peces. Uno los puede ver apresurados y en su mundo.
A diferencia de la UCLA aqui los estudiantes se ven mas arreglados, serios y menos distra√≠dos
Tambi√©n se puede observar la casa donde vivieron presidentes en su √©poca de estudiantes y hasta un Bill Gates. Fue muy √∫til la explicaci√≥n en espa√±ol del gu√≠a del Tour.

Altrettanto sbaglia chi restasse deluso perch√® non pu√≤ visitare nessun edificio: assicuro che le aule di Harvard, le sue biblioteche, i laboratori, i dormitori sono esattamente come quelli di quasi tutte le circa 3.300 universit√† degli Stati Uniti, anzi, alcune ne hanno di migliori. Di diverso, Harvard ha la storia e il valore: a testimonianza dell'importanza attribuita all'educazione, Harvard √® stata fondata dai Padri Pellegrini nel 1636, solo 15 anni dopo il loro sbarco sulle coste del Massachusetts. Il suo nome ricorda un oscuro pastore protestante morto a poco pi√π di 30 anni, che lasci√≤ a una scuola gi√† esistente il patrimonio dei suoi 2.000 libri. Grazie all'impegno e alla dedizione profusi negli ultimi 300 anni dal personale docente e non docente, Harvard √® diventata la prima Universit√† al mondo o comunque una delle prime due al mondo. Il modello didattico prevede l'elevatissima qualit√† dell'insegnamento (molti professori sono premi Nobel), l'applicazione di criteri di valutazione meritocratici, rigore, ordine e severit√†. I risultati? Da Harvard sono usciti i Presidenti americani Theodore Roosevelt, John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Barack Obama, il VIce Presidente Al Gore, un numero impressionante di presidenti canadesi e latino americani, il Premier israeliano Netanyahu e poi BIll Gates, l'Aga Khan e pure un tal Kaszinsky, meglio noto come ""Unabomber"" (forse una difettosit√† nei criteri di selezione all'ingresso?). Non tutti i laureati ad Harvard si sono buttati in politica o negli affari: Jack Lemmon, Matt Damon, Tommy Lee Jones, Natalie Portman a altri hanno fatto del cinema, Mark Zuckerberg ha inventato Facebook e Jeremy Lin √® una stella dei New York Knickerborkers di basket. Sorvolo sulla ventina di istituti di ricerca, sui PhD, sui Master: quelli potete guardarveli nel sito dell'Universit√†. Se si sa cosa √® Harvard, aggirarsi tra gli edifici del campus o guardare la statua di John Harvard regala la stessa emozione che si pu√≤ provare entrando in un santuario.
